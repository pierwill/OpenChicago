**OpenChicago**
================

**(Work in progress)**

Readable, attractive documentation is essential to everything from usablility and maintainability to security. 
But code documentation style guides are often limited to formatting of code blocks and other technical elements.
**OpenChicago** aims to bring the technical precision of code documentation to its natural language style, usage, and punctuation.

**OpenChicago** will allow documentation maintainers to import a set of recommendations for their documentation, whether written by open-source communities, programmers hotfixing at 3am, or professional writers.
There will be multiple versions: from a basic set of code styling and bare-bones punctuation guidelines, to more sophisticated writing guidelines regarding paragraphing, organization, and style.

**OpenChicago** takes its name, spirit, and organizing principles from the last public-domain edition of the *Chicago Manual of Style* `(7th edition, 1920)`_, and was inspired by working on the documentation for `SecureDrop`_.
