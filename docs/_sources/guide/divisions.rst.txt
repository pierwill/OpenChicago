Divisions
=========

215. Avoid all unnecessary divisions of words. Wherever consistent with good spacing, carry the whole word over into the next line.

216. Do not, in wide measures (20 ems or more), divide on a syllable of two letters, if possible to avoid it.  Never carry over a syllable of two letters. Good spacing, however, is paramount. Words of four letters like on-ly should never be divided; words of five or six like oc-cur, of-fice, let-ter rarely.

217. Never let more than two consecutive lines termi- nate in a hyphen, if at all avoidable. The next to the last line in a paragraph ought not to end in a divided word; and the last line (the "breakline") should, in measures of 15 ems and up, contain at least four letters. Similarly, try to avoid a divided word at the bottom of a right-hand (recto) page.

218. Do not divide proper nouns, especially names of persons, unless absolutely necessary.

219. Do not separate (i.e., put in different lines) the initials of a name, or such combinations as 1496 A.D., 6:00 P.M., 6 43. 6d.

220. Avoid the separation of a divisional mark, e.g., (a) or (i), in the middle of a sentence, from the section which it precedes; i.e., do not allow such mark to fall at the end of a line, but carry it over with the matter to which it pertains.

221. Divide according to pronunciation (the American system), not according to derivation (the English system) :

     democ-racy, not: demo-cracy; knowl-edge, not: know-ledge; aurif-erous, not: auri-ferous; antip-odes (still better: antipo- des see 224), not: anti-podes.

     As far as is compatible with pronunciation and good spacing, however, divide compounds on etymologi- cal lines, or according to derivation and meaning:

     dis-pleasure is better than displeas-ure; school-master, than schoolmas-ter; never: passo-ver, une-ven, etc.

     Never divide on a syllable with a silent vowel,

     such as:

     possi-ble, vex-ed, enti-tled, princi-ples.

222. When two consonants meet between vowels, and the syllable ends on one consonant, the division may properly be made between the consonants, the pronunciation determining the place of division:

     advan-tage, exces-sive, finan-cier, foun-da-tion, impor-tant, In-dian, moun-tain, profes-sor, struc-ture.

223. Do not terminate a line in a soft c or g y or in a j.  Escape the division entirely, if possible; if not pos- sible, divide:

     pro-cess, not: proc-ess; ne-cessary, not: nec-essary; spa- cing, not: spac-ing (the rule being that in present parti-

     ciples the -ing should be carried over); pro-geny, not: prog-eny; pre-judice, not: prej-udice.

     NOTE. This rule differs from that followed by Webster and other dictionaries.

224. Divide on a vowel wherever practicable. In case a vowel alone forms a syllable in the middle of a word, run it into the first line:

     sepa-rate, not: sep-arate; particu-lar, not: partic-ular; criti-cism, not: crit-icism.

     Exceptions are words in -able and -ible, which should

     carry the vowel over into the next line:

     read-able, not: reada-ble; convert-ible, not: converti-ble.

225. In hyphenated nouns and adjectives avoid additional hyphens:

     object-lesson, not: object-les-son; fellow-being, not: fel- low-being; poverty-stricken, not: pov-erty-stricken, much less: pover-ty-stricken.

226. A coalition of two vowel-sounds into one (i.e., a diphthong) should be treated as one letter. There- fore do not divide:

     peo-ple (either syllable makes a bad division), Cae-sar (cf. 218), bu-ilding.

227. In derivatives from words ending in t, the t, in divisions, should be carried into the next line with the suffix if the accent has been shifted; if the deriva- tive has retained the accent of the parent-word, the / should be left in the first line :

     objec-tive (from ob'ject); defect-ive (from defect'); but: respec-tively, distinc-tive.

228. The addition of a plural s, adding a new syllable to words ending in an s-sound, does not create a new excuse for dividing such words:

     hor-ses and circumstan-ces are impossible divisions.

229. Adjectives in -ical should be divided on the i: physi-cal, not phys-ical nor physic-al.

230. Do not divide nothing.
