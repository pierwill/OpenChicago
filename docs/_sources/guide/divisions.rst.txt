DIVISIONS 

215. Avoid all unnecessary divisions of words. Wherever 
consistent with good spacing, carry the whole word 
over into the next line. 

216. Do not, in wide measures (20 ems or more), divide 
on a syllable of two letters, if possible to avoid it. 
Never carry over a syllable of two letters. Good 
spacing, however, is paramount. Words of four 
letters like on-ly should never be divided; words 
of five or six like oc-cur, of-fice, let-ter rarely. 

217. Never let more than two consecutive lines termi- 
nate in a hyphen, if at all avoidable. The next to 
the last line in a paragraph ought not to end in a 
divided word; and the last line (the "breakline") 
should, in measures of 15 ems and up, contain at 
least four letters. Similarly, try to avoid a divided 
word at the bottom of a right-hand (recto) page. 

218. Do not divide proper nouns, especially names of 
persons, unless absolutely necessary. 

219. Do not separate (i.e., put in different lines) the 
initials of a name, or such combinations as 1496 A.D., 
6:00 P.M., 6 43. 6d. 

220. Avoid the separation of a divisional mark, e.g., (a) 
or (i), in the middle of a sentence, from the section

which it precedes; i.e., do not allow such mark to 
fall at the end of a line, but carry it over with the 
matter to which it pertains. 

221. Divide according to pronunciation (the American 
system), not according to derivation (the English 
system) : 

democ-racy, not: demo-cracy; knowl-edge, not: know-ledge; 
aurif-erous, not: auri-ferous; antip-odes (still better: antipo- 
des see 224), not: anti-podes. 

As far as is compatible with pronunciation and good 
spacing, however, divide compounds on etymologi- 
cal lines, or according to derivation and meaning: 

dis-pleasure is better than displeas-ure; school-master, 
than schoolmas-ter; never: passo-ver, une-ven, etc. 

Never divide on a syllable with a silent vowel, 

such as: 

possi-ble, vex-ed, enti-tled, princi-ples. 

222. When two consonants meet between vowels, and 
the syllable ends on one consonant, the division 
may properly be made between the consonants, the 
pronunciation determining the place of division: 

advan-tage, exces-sive, finan-cier, foun-da-tion, impor-tant, 
In-dian, moun-tain, profes-sor, struc-ture. 

223. Do not terminate a line in a soft c or g y or in a j. 
Escape the division entirely, if possible; if not pos- 
sible, divide: 

pro-cess, not: proc-ess; ne-cessary, not: nec-essary; spa- 
cing, not: spac-ing (the rule being that in present parti- 



MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 83 

ciples the -ing should be carried over); pro-geny, not: 
prog-eny; pre-judice, not: prej-udice. 

NOTE. This rule differs from that followed by Webster and 
other dictionaries. 

224. Divide on a vowel wherever practicable. In case a 
vowel alone forms a syllable in the middle of a word, 
run it into the first line: 

sepa-rate, not: sep-arate; particu-lar, not: partic-ular; 
criti-cism, not: crit-icism. 

Exceptions are words in -able and -ible, which should 

carry the vowel over into the next line: 

read-able, not: reada-ble; convert-ible, not: converti-ble. 

225. In hyphenated nouns and adjectives avoid additional 
hyphens: 

object-lesson, not: object-les-son; fellow-being, not: fel- 
low-being; poverty-stricken, not: pov-erty-stricken, much 
less: pover-ty-stricken. 

226. A coalition of two vowel-sounds into one (i.e., a 
diphthong) should be treated as one letter. There- 
fore do not divide: 

peo-ple (either syllable makes a bad division), Cae-sar 
(cf. 218), bu-ilding. 

227. In derivatives from words ending in t, the t, in 
divisions, should be carried into the next line with 
the suffix if the accent has been shifted; if the deriva- 
tive has retained the accent of the parent-word, 
the / should be left in the first line : 

objec-tive (from ob'ject); defect-ive (from defect'); but: 
respec-tively, distinc-tive.

228. The addition of a plural s, adding a new syllable 
to words ending in an s-sound, does not create a 
new excuse for dividing such words: 

hor-ses and circumstan-ces are impossible divisions. 

229. Adjectives in -ical should be divided on the i: 
physi-cal, not phys-ical nor physic-al. 

230. Do not divide nothing. 

231. The following are condensed rules for dividing 
words in the foreign languages most frequently met 
with in proofreading. While perhaps not entirely 
comprehensive, they will be found to cover every 
ordinary contingency. 

FRENCH 

a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a 
vowel as far as possible, avoiding consonantal end- 
ing of syllables: 

in-di-vi-si-bi-li-te, a-che-ter; ta-bleau (not: tab-leau); 
ba-lancer (not: bal-ancer). 

6) Two consonants of which the second is / or r 
(but not the combinations rl, Ir), are both carried 
over to the following syllable: 

ta-bleau, e"-cri-vain, per-dre, qua-tre; par-ler, hur-ler. 

c) There are as many syllables as there are vowels, 

even if soundless: 

par-lent, vic-toi-re, pro-pri-e'-tai-re, guer-re, fil-les; 



MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 85 

but a mute e following a vowel does not form a 

syllable: 

e-taient, joue-rai; 

and i, y, o, ou, u, when preceding other vowels, are 

often sounded as consonants, and then do not form 

a syllable: 

bien, 6-tions, yeux, loin, fouet-ter, 6-cuel-le. 

GERMAN 

a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a 
vowel as far as possible: 

hii-ten, le-ben, Fa-brik. 

b) If several consonants stand between vowels, 
usually only the last is carried over: 

Rit-ter, klir-ren, Klemp-ner, Ver-wand-te, Karp-fen. 

c) sz, ch, sch, ph, st, th are never separated (but see 
(/) below): 

Bu-sze, Be-cher, Ha-scher (but: Haus-chen), Geo-gra-phie, 
La-sten, Ma-thilde. 

d) If ck must be divided, it is separated into k-k: 
Deckel Dek-kel. 

e) In foreign words (Fremdivorter) , combinations of 
b, d, g, k, p, t, with I or r are carried over: 
Pu-bli-kum, Me-trum, Hy-drant. 

/) Compound words are separated first into their 
component elements, and within each element the 
foregoing rules apply: 
Fursten-schlosz, Tur-an-gel, Inter-esse.

ITALIAN 

a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a 
vowel as far as possible: 

ta-vo-li-no, nar-ra-re. 

b) s before a consonant, r following a consonant, 
ch, gh, gli (gl), gn, qu, sc, d, fl, gl, pi are never 
separated: 

ca-sti-ghi, a-vro, mi-gli6-re, bi-so-gno, in-chi6-stro, u-scire. 

c) i=y and u=w go with the following vowel; 
ac, au, ei, eu, oi are not separated: 

miei, tuoi. 

SPANISH 

a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a 
vowel as far as possible: 

ca-ra-co-les, re-ba-no, fle-xi-bi-li-dad. 

b) br, bl, ch, cl, cr, dr, II, pr, rr, tr, and n, being 
regarded as simple consonants, follow the fore- 
going rule; cc and nn are divided, as in English: 
mu-cha-cho, ba-ta-lla, bu-116, ba-rre-rio, ci-ga-rro; ac-ce-so, 
en-no-ble-cer, in-ne-ga-ble. 

c) The liquid consonants / and r, when preceded by 
any consonant other than s, must not be separated 
from that consonant, except in uniting parts of 
compound words: 

ha-blar, po-dria, ce-le-bra-ci-on, si-glo; but sub-lu-nar, 
sub-ra-yar, es-la-bon. 

d} Two separable consonants should be divided; 
5 is always disjoined from a following consonant: 
cuer-da, chas-co, pron-to; has-ta, as-pi-rar, cons-pi-rar. 



MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 87 

GREEK 

a) Single consonants, combinations of consonants 
which can begin a word, and mutes followed by p 
or v are placed at the beginning of a syllable: 

-^o), e-yw, e-OTre-pa, ve'-Krap, d-K/x,?7, Se-oytds, /ni-xpov, Trpa- 
y/ia-Tos, yi-yvd>-<rKw. 

Other combinations of consonants are divided: 

irpacr-crw, eA-7rts, v-8ov, ap-/ta-Ta. 

6) Compound words are divided into their original 
parts; subject to that the foregoing rule applies: 

7rpo<r-a-y<i>, 7rap-a-yw. 

LATIN 

a) A Latin word has as many syllables as it has 
vowels or diphthongs (ae, au, oe, ei, eu, ui). 

b) When a single consonant occurs between two 
vowels, divide before the consonant: 

Cae-sar, me-ri-di-es. 

c) In the case of two or more consonants divide 
before the last consonant, except in the combina- 
tions: mute (p, ph, b, t, th, d, c, ch, g)+liquid (/, r), 
and qu or gu: 

om-nis, scrip-tus, cunc-tus (but: pa-tris, e-quus, lin-gua). 

d) Compound words are separated first into their 
component elements, and within each element the 
foregoing rules apply: 

ad-est, ab-rum-po, red-e-o, trans-i-go.
