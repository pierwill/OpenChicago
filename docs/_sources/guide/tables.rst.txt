TABULAR WORK 

241. In n-pt. and zo-pt. matter open (unruled) tables 
should ordinarily be set in 9 pt. leaded; ruled, in 
8 pt. solid. In 9-pt. matter both open and ruled 
tables should be set in 8 pt. solid. In 8-pt. matter 
open tables should be set in 6 pt. leaded; ruled, in 
6 pt. solid. In 6-pt. matter both open and ruled 
tables should be set in 6 pt. solid. For columns 
representing totals, averages, percentages, and 
generalizations italic and black-face figures may 
be used if desired to set off the various classes of 
results. (See Table III, p. 100.) 

242. Captions for the columns of open tables and box- 
heads for ruled tables should ordinarily be set in 
6 pt. Box-heads of open tables should be 6-pt. caps 
and lower case unless subheads are used, in which 
case caps and small caps are used for the upper 
head (see Table III, p. 100). In ruled tables with 
box-heads of several stories the upper story pri- 
mary heads should be set in caps and small caps, 
except where the second story consists of figures 
only (see Table I, p. 98) ; the lower secondary in 
caps and lower case. Wherever small caps are 
used in box-heads, the heading for the "stub" (i.e., 
first column) should, as a rule, also be set in caps 
and small caps.

243. In ruled tables there should be at least two leads' 
space between the horizontal rules and the matter 
inclosed, and, if practicable, at least the equivalent 
of an en quad, of the type in which the body of 
the table is set, between the perpendicular rules and 
the matter inclosed. 

244. In open tables either periods, one em apart and 
aligned, or leaders, may be used between the col- 
umns (see 248). In ruled tables, in the "stub," 
leaders should usually be employed, if there is room, 
except in case the stub runs over and a brace is 
necessary. (A leader is a piece of type, having dots 
["period leader"] or short lines ["hyphen leader"] 
upon its face, used in tables, indexes, etc., to 
lead the eye across a space to the right word or 
number.) An en leader is used instead of a 
decimal point in tables. 

245. In ruled columns of figures, to express a blank use 
leaders across the full width of the column. Cen- 
ter the figures in the column; if they cannot be put 
in the exact center, and there is an unequal number 
of digits in the groups, leave more space on the left 
than on the right. All decimals and dollar signs 
or other concrete values should be aligned. 

246. When there is reading-matter in the columns of a 
ruled table, it should be centered, if possible; if any 
line runs over, use hanging indention, and align all 
on the left. 



MANUAL OF STYLE: TABULAR WORK 97 

247. Double rules should be used at the top of all tables, 
but perpendicularly, as a usual thing, only when a 
table is doubled up on itself and the stub is re- 
peated. (See Table IV, p. 100.) In continued 
broadside tables, where the heading is not repeated 
use a single rule only. Repeat heading on each 
even page. 

248. Tables of two columns only should be set open; 
of three or more, ruled, except in such a case as 
the table on page 99. All continuations of tables 
should be of the same dimensions, even if blank 
columns are necessary, and tables with identical 
headings should stand parallel. 

249. "Table I," etc., in headlines of tables should ordi- 
narily be set in caps of the type in which the body of 
the table is set and should not exceed the width of 
the table; the following (descriptive) line, if any, 
should be set in caps and small caps of the same 
type. A single descriptive headline, not pre- 
ceded by the number of the table, should be set 
in caps of the type in which the table is set. A 
footnote to the table should be set in 6 pt. with a 
paragraph indention, and should not exceed the 
width of the table. But when 6-pt. and 8-pt. ruled 
tables are both used in the same work, use 8-pt. 
headings over all tables (see 234). When tables 
containing footnotes run over several pages, it is 
necessary to repeat the footnotes on each even page.
