<p>FOOTNOTES</p>
<p>232. For reference indexes, as a rule, use superior figures.
Only in special cases should asterisks, daggers, etc.,
be employed (see 234); for instance, in tabular or
algebraic matter, where figures would be likely to
cause confusion. Index figures in the text should be
placed after the punctuation marks, without space,
except in German, where they are placed inside:</p>
<p>…. the niceties of style which were then invading Attic
prose, 1 and which made ….</p>
<p>1 In particular the avoidance of hiatus.
p^y+jt*</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Schenk’s equation.</li>
</ul>
<p>When figures are not used, the sequence of indexes
should be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(“asterisk” or “star”), f (“dagger”), % (“double dagger”),</li>
</ul>
<p>(“section mark”), || (“parallels”), ^ (“paragraph mark”).</p>
<p>233. Where references to the same work follow each
other closely and uninterruptedly, use ibid, instead
of repeating the title. Thus ibid, takes the place
of as much of the previous reference as is repeated:</p>
<p>Spencer, Principles of Sociology, chap, iv., p. 128.</p>
<p>Ibid., p. 129.</p>
<p>Barnes, “Charles Stunner,” Jour, of Pol. Econ., XXXV, 427.</p>
<p>Ibid., p. 435-</p>
<p>Ibid, should, however, not ordinarily be used for
the first footnote on a verso (left-hand) page; it is</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: FOOTNOTES 89</p>
<p>better usage either to repeat the title or, if the
reference is to the whole citation, to use loc. cit.
(the place cited) or op. cit. (the work cited) or
a.a.O. (am angezeigten Orte) in German:</p>
<p>‘Smith, Wealth of Nations, p. 289.</p>
<p>3 Loc. cit. (on verso page if exactly the same place is cited), or</p>
<p>3 Smith, op. cit., p. 290.</p>
<p>However op. cit. is not used to repeat the title of a
journal, but it may be used to refer to an author’s
work in a periodical and should not be used with-
out the author’s name clearly in text or footnote.</p>
<p>234. Footnotes to tables, whether the tables are ruled or
open, should be in 6 pt, and should invariably be
placed at the foot of the table and not at the foot of
the page. For reference indexes in such cases use
asterisks, etc., and not superior figures (see 232).</p>
<p>235. If the author’s name is given in the text in connec-
tion with a reference to, or a quotation from, his
work, it should not be repeated in the footnote:</p>
<p>…. This theory is questioned by Herbert, as follows-
“I cannot admit … .”’</p>
<p>1 Laws of the Ancients, 1, 153.</p>
<p>236. It is better to place the index figure in the text at
the end of the quotation (see illustration above).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="237">
<li>Ordinarily, omit “Vol.,” “chap.,” and “p.” in paren-</li>
</ol>
<p>thetical or footnote references to particular pas-
sages. Use Roman numerals (capitals) for Volume,</p>
<p>90 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>Book, Part, Division, except in reference to ancient
classical works, when lower-case roman numerals
should be used; Roman numerals (lower-case) for
chapter and pages of introductory matter (Preface,
etc.) ; and Arabic numerals for number (Heft) and
text pages. Only when confusion would be liable
to arise, use ” Vol.,” “p.,” etc., in connection with the
numerals; but where the reference is to a page, un-
accompanied by further details, the abbreviation
“p.” or “pp.” must of course be used. In text
matter, not parenthetical, spell out chapter, verse,
page, line, note, figure, etc. In classical references
use no comma between author’s name and the title
of his work, and no comma following the title, unless
“Vol.,” “p.,” or some kindred symbol is used. In
all references to divisions of classical or ancient
works use periods in place of commas, reserving the
comma to indicate a succession (of pages, etc.) :</p>

<p>The same practice prescribed for classical references
is frequently desired by authors with respect to
English references, and may with equal propriety
be followed:</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: FOOTNOTES 91</p>
<p>1 W. W. Greg Pastoral Poetry and Pastoral Drama (London
1906) 114.</p>
<p>238. The date of publication in a reference to a periodical
should be put in parentheses immediately following
the volume number:</p>
<p>1 Barnes, “Lester Frank Ward,” Amer. Jour, of Social., XXV
(1919), 89.</p>
<p>If the citation is to month, year, and page only, the
date may appear in its natural order with commas:</p>
<p>3 “Problems of Reconstruction,” Journal of Political Economy,
May, 1919, p. 89.</p>
<p>239. In work set on the linotype machine, footnotes should
be renumbered consecutively through each article,
in a journal, or through each chapter, in a book,
to save resetting in case of change (see “Hints to
Authors and Editors,” note under “Footnotes,”
p. 122).</p>
<p>NOTE. Exceptions to these rules are footnotes in the Botani-
cal Gazette and the Astrophysical Journal, which have adopted
the following styles:</p>
<p>Botanical Gazette</p>
<p>1 LIVINGSTON, B. E., (i) On the nature of the stimulus which
causes the change in form of polymorphic green algae. BOT.
GAZ. 30:289-317. 1900.</p>
<p>3 , (2) The heredity of sex. Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool.</p>
<p>40:187-218. 1903.</p>
<p>Astrophysical Journal</p>
<p>1 ” Revision of Wolf’s Sun-Spot Relative Numbers,” Monthly
Weather Review, 30, 171, 1902.</p>
<p>3 Astrophysical Journal, 10, 333, 1899.</p>
<p>Botanical Gazette numbers its footnotes consecutively through-
out an article; all the other journals of the University of Chicago
Press number their footnotes from i up on each page, except
in special cases.</p>
