<p>nor such words as the following, when used in</p>
<p>their special scientific or trade significance:</p>

<p>NOTE. Personal preference is responsible for the following ex- ceptions: Henry van Dyke, J. H. van’t Hoff, A. van Maanen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" start="5">

<p>oriental customs, the southern states, the middle western states, a southerner (but: Northman = Scandinavian) ; an invasion of barbarians from the north, extending through the south of Europe.</p>
<p>In order that a distinction may be made between a local and a world-wide application, the latter should be capitalized:</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">Generic terms for political divisions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<p>the empire, the state; empire of Russia, kingdom of Servia, duchy of Anhalt, state of Illinois, county of Cook, city of Chicago; but: the Empire (meaning the Roman Empire).</p>

<p>But do not capitalize such general designations of buildings as “courthouse,” “post-office,” “library,” etc., except in connection with the name of the place in which they are located, when they thus form a proper name.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The names of political parties, religious denomina- tions or sects, and philosophical, literary, and artistic schools, and their adherents:</p>
<p>Republican, Conservative, National Liberal, Social Democ- racy (where, as in Continental Europe, it is organized as a distinct parliamentary faction); Christian, Protestantism</p>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="22">
<li>Abbreviations like Ph.D., M.P., and F.R.G.S., and</li>
</ol>
<p>designations of celestial objects (see 48) (such titles to be set without space between the letters) (see 52, 103, 106).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="23">

</ol>
<p>R.V. (Revised Version), F. (Fahrenheit), C. (centigrade), A (angstrom units) (but: p., 1., n., etc.).</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="24">
<li><p class="first">Nouns and adjectives used to designate the Supreme Being or Power, or any member of the Christian Trinity; and all pronouns referring to the same, when not closely preceded or followed by a dis- tinctive name, or unless such reference is otherwise perfectly clear:</p>
<p>the Almighty, Ruler of the universe, the First Cause, the Absolute, Providence (personified), Father, Son, Holy Ghost, the Spirit, Savior, Messiah, Son of Man, the Logos, [and the Virgin Mary]; “Trust Him who rules all things” (but: “When God had worked six days, he rested on the seventh”).</p>
<p>But do not capitalize such expressions and deriva- tives as</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Words which have an acquired, limited, or special meaning:</p>
<p>the Doctor’s degree; a report of the Master (in chancery); a Bachelor’s hood; a Freshman.</p>
<p>But do not capitalize such expressions as the doctorate, a master in chancery (the last two words being explanatory, the capitalization of “master” is here no longer necessary to indicate a special meaning).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">“Nature” and similar terms, and abstract ideas, when personified:</p>
<p>“Nature wields her scepter mercilessly”; “Vice in the old English morality plays.”</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">“Father” used for church father, and “reformers” used of Reformation leaders, whenever the meaning otherwise would be ambiguous:</p>
<p>the Fathers, the early Fathers, the Greek Fathers, [Pilgrim Fathers], the Reformers (but: the church reformers of the fifteenth century).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The word “church” in properly cited titles of nationally organized bodies of believers in which, through historical associations, it has become insepa- rably linked with the name of a specific locality; or when forming part of the name of a particular edifice:</p>
<p>Church of Rome, Church of England, High Church; Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Fifth Avenue Baptist Church, First Methodist Church.</p>
<p>But do not capitalize, except as noted above, when standing alone, in any sense universal, national,</p>
<p>local or when the name is not correctly or fully quoted :</p>
<p>the church (= organized Christianity), the Eastern (Greek Orthodox) church, the Roman Catholic church, the estab- lished church (but: the Establishment), the state church; the Baptist church in Englewood.</p>
<p>NOTE. In exceptional cases, where the opposition of Church and State constitutes a fundamental part of the argument, and it is desired to lend force to this antithesis, emphasis may be added by capitalizing the two words.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" start="35">
<li><p class="first">The first word after a colon only when introducing a complete passage, or sentence which would have independent meaning, as in summarizations and quotations not closely connected with what precedes; or where the colon has the weight of such expres- sion as “as follows,” “namely,” “for instance,” or a similar phrase, and is followed by a logically com- plete sentence:</p>
<p>“In conclusion I wish to say: It will be seen from the above that ….”; “As the old proverb has it: ‘Haste makes waste’”; “My theory is: The moment the hot current strikes the surface … .”</p>
<p>But do not capitalize the first word of a quotation if immediately connected with what precedes (unless, as the first word of a sentence, beginning a paragraph in reduced type) ; or the first word after a colon, if an implied “namely,” or a similar term, is followed by a brief explanatory phrase, logically dependent upon the preceding clause:</p>
<p>“The old adage is true that ‘haste makes waste’”; “Two explanations present themselves: either he came too late for the train, or he was detained at the station.”</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">As a rule, the first word in sections of an enumera- tion, if any one link contains two or more distinct clauses, separated by a semicolon, colon, or period, unless all are dependent upon the same term pre- ceding and leading up to them (see 138) :</p>
<p>His reasons for refusal were three: (i) He did not have the time. (2) He did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no funds available at the moment. (3) He doubted the feasi- bility of the plan. But: He objected that (i) he did not have the time; (2) he did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no funds available; (3) he doubted the feasibility of the plan.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">As a rule, nouns followed by a numeral particu- larly a capitalized Roman numeral indicating their order in a sequence; also sums of money in German and French:</p>
<p>Room 16, Ps. 20, Grade IV, Act I, Vol. I, No. 2, Book II, Div. Ill, Part IV, Plate III; M. 6; Fr. 5.</p>
<p>But do not capitalize such minor subdivisions of publications as</p>
<p>sec 4, scene i, art. “Evidence,” chap. 2 (ii), p. 7 (vii), vs. n, 1. 5, n. 6. (See no.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The first word of a cited speech (or thought) in direct discourse, whether preceded by a colon or a comma (on this see 131):</p>
<p>On leaving he remarked: “Never shall I forget this day”; With the words, “Never shall I forget this day,” he departed; I thought to myself: This day I shall never forget (without quotation marks).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" start="41">
<li><p class="first">All the principal words (i.e., nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, first and last words) in English titles of publications (books, pamphlets, doc- uments, periodicals, reports, proceedings, etc.), and their divisions (parts, chapters, sections, poems, articles, etc.) ; in subjects of lectures, papers, toasts, etc.; in cap-and-small-cap and italic center-heads (both of which, however, should be avoided), and bold-face cut-in heads and side-heads; in cap-and- small-cap box-heads in tables (see 279-83) :</p>
<p>The Men Who Made the Nation; The American College Its Past and Present; the Report of the Committee oj Nine; “In the Proceedings of the National Education Association for 1907 there appeared a paper entitled, ‘The Financial Value of Education.’”</p>
<p>NOTE. The Botanical Gazette capitalizes only first words and proper names; and the practice may properly be followed in general bibliographies, such as are to be found under the title “Literature Cited” in the Botanical Gazette (see 60). This style is very generally followed by librarians and others in the com- pilation of lists of books and publications.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In foreign titles, in addition to capitalizing the first word, follow these general rules:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">

<p>derived therefrom:</p>
<p>De amicitia, Bettum Gallicum.</p>

<p>But do not capitalize such components when other than nouns:</p>
<p>Fifty-first Street, “Lives of Well-known Authors,” “World- Dominion of English-speaking Peoples.”</p>
