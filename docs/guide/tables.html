<h1>Tables<a class="headerlink" href="#tables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="241">
<li>In n-pt. and zo-pt. matter open (unruled) tables should ordinarily be set in 9 pt. leaded; ruled, in 8 pt. solid. In 9-pt. matter both open and ruled tables should be set in 8 pt. solid. In 8-pt. matter open tables should be set in 6 pt. leaded; ruled, in 6 pt. solid. In 6-pt. matter both open and ruled tables should be set in 6 pt. solid. For columns representing totals, averages, percentages, and generalizations italic and black-face figures may be used if desired to set off the various classes of results. (See Table III, p. 100.)</li>
<li>Captions for the columns of open tables and box- heads for ruled tables should ordinarily be set in 6 pt. Box-heads of open tables should be 6-pt. caps and lower case unless subheads are used, in which case caps and small caps are used for the upper head (see Table III, p. 100). In ruled tables with box-heads of several stories the upper story pri- mary heads should be set in caps and small caps, except where the second story consists of figures only (see Table I, p. 98) ; the lower secondary in caps and lower case. Wherever small caps are used in box-heads, the heading for the “stub” (i.e., first column) should, as a rule, also be set in caps and small caps.</li>
<li>In ruled tables there should be at least two leads’ space between the horizontal rules and the matter inclosed, and, if practicable, at least the equivalent of an en quad, of the type in which the body of the table is set, between the perpendicular rules and the matter inclosed.</li>
<li>In open tables either periods, one em apart and aligned, or leaders, may be used between the col- umns (see 248). In ruled tables, in the “stub,” leaders should usually be employed, if there is room, except in case the stub runs over and a brace is necessary. (A leader is a piece of type, having dots [“period leader”] or short lines [“hyphen leader”] upon its face, used in tables, indexes, etc., to lead the eye across a space to the right word or number.) An en leader is used instead of a decimal point in tables.</li>
<li>In ruled columns of figures, to express a blank use leaders across the full width of the column. Cen- ter the figures in the column; if they cannot be put in the exact center, and there is an unequal number of digits in the groups, leave more space on the left than on the right. All decimals and dollar signs or other concrete values should be aligned.</li>
<li>When there is reading-matter in the columns of a ruled table, it should be centered, if possible; if any line runs over, use hanging indention, and align all on the left.</li>
<li>Double rules should be used at the top of all tables, but perpendicularly, as a usual thing, only when a table is doubled up on itself and the stub is re- peated. (See Table IV, p. 100.) In continued broadside tables, where the heading is not repeated use a single rule only. Repeat heading on each even page.</li>
<li>Tables of two columns only should be set open; of three or more, ruled, except in such a case as the table on page 99. All continuations of tables should be of the same dimensions, even if blank columns are necessary, and tables with identical headings should stand parallel.</li>
<li>“Table I,” etc., in headlines of tables should ordi- narily be set in caps of the type in which the body of the table is set and should not exceed the width of the table; the following (descriptive) line, if any, should be set in caps and small caps of the same type. A single descriptive headline, not pre- ceded by the number of the table, should be set in caps of the type in which the table is set. A footnote to the table should be set in 6 pt. with a paragraph indention, and should not exceed the width of the table. But when 6-pt. and 8-pt. ruled tables are both used in the same work, use 8-pt.  headings over all tables (see 234). When tables containing footnotes run over several pages, it is necessary to repeat the footnotes on each even page.</li>
