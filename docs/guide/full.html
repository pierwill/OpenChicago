<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>
<p>The present work is a codification of the typographical
rules employed by the University of Chicago in connection
with its official printing and publications issued through
its University Press. Having its genesis, over two
decades ago, in a single sheet of fundamentals, jotted
down by the first proofreader at odd moments for his
own guidance; added to from year to year, as oppor-
tunity offered or new necessities arose; revised and
re-revised as the scope of the work, and, it is hoped, the
wisdom of the workers, increased it emerges in its present
form as the embodiment of traditions, the crystallization
of usages, the blended product of the reflections of many
minds.</p>
<p>Regulations like these, hi the nature of the case,
cannot be endowed with the fixity of unchanging law.
They are meant for the average case, and must be
applied with a certain degree of elasticity. Exceptions
will constantly occur, and ample room is left for individual
initiative and discretion. They point the way and survey
the road, rather than remove the obstacles. Throughout
this book it is assumed that no regulation contained therein
is absolutely inviolable. Wherever the peculiar nature of
the subject-matter, the desirability of throwing into relief
a certain part of the argument, the reasonable preference</p>
<p>501579 .</p>
<p>vi INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>
<p>of a writer, or a typographical contingency suggests a
deviation, such deviation may legitimately be made. Each
case of this character must be decided largely upon its
own merits. Generally it may be stated that, where no
question of taste or logic is involved, deference should
be shown to the expressed wishes of the author.</p>
<p>The nature of the work of the Press itself and this
will apply, to a greater or less extent, to any similar in-
stitution affected by local conditions constantly calls for
modification, now of this rule, now of that. It would be
found impracticable, even were it desirable, to bring all
its publications into rigid uniformity of “style” and
appearance. Methods have been devised, systems evolved,
in certain lines of work, which cannot be carried bodily
over into the field of others. Thus, in the matter of literary
references, for instance, general practice has established
certain usages in some of the sciences which it would not
be advisable to ignore. Similar differences in practice
may be observed in other directions. These deviations
from the general rules will be found mentioned at the
appropriate places in the body of the book. On the whole,
however, the rules are designed to govern all publications
sent forth with the official publishing imprint, “The
University of Chicago Press.”</p>
<p>Concerning the character and contents of the book
little need be added. Its origin, its primary aim, and its
limitations, as outlined above, will suggest the bounds of
its usefulness. It does not pretend to be exhaustive; a
few things must be taken for granted, and the traditional</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE vn</p>
<p>territory of the dictionary has only exceptionally been
invaded. It does not presume to be inflexibly consistent;
applicability, in the printing-office, is a better test than
iron-clad consistency, and common sense a safer guide
than abstract logic. It lays no claim to perfection in any
of its parts; bearing throughout the inevitable earmarks
of compromise, it will not carry conviction at every point
to everybody. Neither is it an advocate of any radical
scheme of reform; in the present state of the agitation
for changes in spelling, progressive conservatism has
been thought to be more appropriate for an academic
printing-office than radicalism. As it stands, this Manual
is believed to contain a fairly comprehensive, reasonably
harmonious, and wholesomely practical set of work-rules
for the aid of those who have to do with questions of
typographical style. For the benefit of those whose duties
bring them into direct contact with the manufacturing
department of the Press, specimen pages of the available
types, special characters, etc., have been added.</p>
<p>The Manual of Style is now in its seventh edition.
That it is recognized as possessing merit is evidenced by
its adoption and use in many editorial offices, libraries,
and proofrooms in the United States and Canada.
This edition incorporates several new rules which it is
believed will prove helpful, and at the same time seeks
to elucidate some of the older rules, in the application
of which difficulties may arise. Changes in literary
practice, the legislation of learned societies, the recent
development of the profession of the librarian, with the</p>
<p>Viii INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>
<p>attendant uniformity of practice recommended by the
national association of librarians, and the added experi-
ence resulting from a daily application of these rules to
a very varied list of publications, are all factors con-
tributing to the need of periodical revision.</p>
<p>The work, thus remodeled, is again offered to the
public, in the hope that it may continue to be useful
to those whose occupations require some familiarity with
the niceties of typographical form.</p>

<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: CAPITALIZATION 17</p>
<p>35. The first word after a colon only when introducing
a complete passage, or sentence which would have
independent meaning, as in summarizations and
quotations not closely connected with what precedes;
or where the colon has the weight of such expres-
sion as “as follows,” “namely,” “for instance,” or
a similar phrase, and is followed by a logically com-
plete sentence:</p>
<p>“In conclusion I wish to say: It will be seen from the above
that ….”; “As the old proverb has it: ‘Haste makes
waste’”; “My theory is: The moment the hot current strikes
the surface … .”</p>
<p>But do not capitalize the first word of a quotation if
immediately connected with what precedes (unless,
as the first word of a sentence, beginning a paragraph
in reduced type) ; or the first word after a colon, if
an implied “namely,” or a similar term, is followed
by a brief explanatory phrase, logically dependent
upon the preceding clause:</p>
<p>“The old adage is true that ‘haste makes waste’”; “Two
explanations present themselves: either he came too late for
the train, or he was detained at the station.”</p>
<p>36. As a rule, the first word in sections of an enumera-
tion, if any one link contains two or more distinct
clauses, separated by a semicolon, colon, or period,
unless all are dependent upon the same term pre-
ceding and leading up to them (see 138) :</p>
<p>His reasons for refusal were three: (i) He did not have the
time. (2) He did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no</p>
<p>l8 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>funds available at the moment. (3) He doubted the feasi-
bility of the plan. But: He objected that (i) he did not
have the time; (2) he did not have the means; or, at any
rate, had no funds available; (3) he doubted the feasibility
of the plan.</p>
<p>37. As a rule, nouns followed by a numeral particu-
larly a capitalized Roman numeral indicating
their order in a sequence; also sums of money in
German and French:</p>
<p>Room 16, Ps. 20, Grade IV, Act I, Vol. I, No. 2, Book II,
Div. Ill, Part IV, Plate III; M. 6; Fr. 5.</p>
<p>But do not capitalize such minor subdivisions of
publications as</p>
<p>sec 4, scene i, art. “Evidence,” chap. 2 (ii), p. 7 (vii),
vs. n, 1. 5, n. 6. (See no.)</p>
<p>38. The first word of a cited speech (or thought) in
direct discourse, whether preceded by a colon or a
comma (on this see 131):</p>
<p>On leaving he remarked: “Never shall I forget this day”;
With the words, “Never shall I forget this day,” he departed;
I thought to myself: This day I shall never forget (without
quotation marks).</p>
<p>39. In resolutions, the first words following ” WHEREAS”
and “Resolved”:</p>
<p>WHEREAS, It has pleased God … . ; therefore be it
Resolved, That ….</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="40">
<li>The exclamations “O” and “Oh” (see 117):</li>

<p>41. All the principal words (i.e., nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, adverbs, verbs, first and last words) in
English titles of publications (books, pamphlets, doc-
uments, periodicals, reports, proceedings, etc.), and
their divisions (parts, chapters, sections, poems,
articles, etc.) ; in subjects of lectures, papers, toasts,
etc.; in cap-and-small-cap and italic center-heads
(both of which, however, should be avoided), and
bold-face cut-in heads and side-heads; in cap-and-
small-cap box-heads in tables (see 279-83) :</p>
<p>The Men Who Made the Nation; The American College
Its Past and Present; the Report of the Committee oj Nine;
“In the Proceedings of the National Education Association
for 1907 there appeared a paper entitled, ‘The Financial
Value of Education.’”</p>
<p>NOTE. The Botanical Gazette capitalizes only first words and
proper names; and the practice may properly be followed in
general bibliographies, such as are to be found under the title
“Literature Cited” in the Botanical Gazette (see 60). This style
is very generally followed by librarians and others in the com-
pilation of lists of books and publications.</p>
<p>42. In foreign titles, in addition to capitalizing the first
word, follow these general rules:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>In Latin, capitalize proper nouns, and adjectives</li>
</ol>
<p>derived therefrom:</p>
<p>De amicitia, Bettum Gallicum.</p>
<p>6) In French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and Nor-
wegian titles, capitalize proper nouns but not ad-
jectives derived therefrom :</p>
<p>20 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>Histoire de la litterature franfaise, Novelle e racconti popolari
iialiani, Antologia de poetas liricos castellanos, Svenska littera-
turens historic.</p>
<p>c} In German and Danish, capitalize all nouns but
not the adjectives, except German adjectives derived
from the names of persons:</p>
<p>Geschichte des deutschen Feudalwesens (but: die Homer ische
Frage), Videnskabens Fremskridt i detnittende Aarhundrede;
and in abbreviations, B.P.W. for Berliner philologische
W ochenschrift.</p>
<p>d) In Dutch, capitalize all nouns, and all adjectives
derived from proper nouns:
Geschiedenis der Nederlandsche Taal.</p>
<p>43. In mentioning titles of newspapers, magazines, and
similar publications, do not, as a rule, treat the
definite article as part of the title:</p>
<p>the Chicago Tribune, the School Review, the Annual Register
of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>44. Titles of ancient manuscripts (singular, MS; plural,
MSS) (see 60):</p>
<p>Codex Bernensis, Cod. Canonicianus.</p>
<p>45. In titles with the main words capitalized, all nouns
forming parts of hyphenated compounds:</p>
<p>“Twentieth-Century Progress,” “The Economy of High-
Speed Trains.”</p>
<p>But do not capitalize such components when other
than nouns:</p>
<p>Fifty-first Street, “Lives of Well-known Authors,” “World-
Dominion of English-speaking Peoples.”</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: CAPITALIZATION 21</p>
<p>And in side-heads do not capitalize any but the first
word and proper nouns (see 56 and 172).</p>
<p>46. In botanical, geological, zoological, and paleonto-
logical matter, the scientific (Latin) names of divi-
sions, orders, families, and genera, but not their
English derivatives:</p>
<p>Cotylosauria, but: cotylosaurs; Felidae, but: felids;
Carnivora, but: carnivores.</p>
<p>Also in botanical and zoological matter, the names
of species, if derived from names of persons, or
from generic names; but in geological and medical
matter the names of species are never capitalized:</p>
<p>Felis leo, Cocos nucifera, Rosa Carolina, Parkinsonia Torrey-
ana, Styrax californica, Lythrum hyssopifolia, Phyleuma
Halleri, Car ex Halleriana (but [geological] : Pterygomatopus
schmidti, Conodectus favosus). (See 71.)</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="47">
<li>The names and epithets of peoples, races, and tribes:</li>
</ol>
<p>Kafir, Negro (in its ethnic sense), Hottentot, Makassar,
Buginese, Celestials.</p>
<p>48. In astronomical work, the names of the bodies of
the planets, stars, and groups of stars (but not
“sun,” “earth,” “moon,” “stars”); designations
of celestial objects in well-known catalogues ; also
the Flams teed numbers:</p>
<p>Saturn, Ursa Major, the Milky Way, the Great Bear;
M 13 (for No. 13 of Messier’s Catalogue of Nebulae and

ment of Anthropology (also: the Department); the Board
of Trustees (the Trustees, the Board), the Senate, the
Council, University College (also: the College), the School

the salutatory phrase at the beginning, of letters,
and the signature and residence at the end of letters
or articles, etc.:</p>

<p>should be run in with the text of the letter, indented as a
paragraph [see 64].)</p>

<p>June 7, 1911</p>
<p>(Set to the left, with two ems’ indention, in smaller type.)
(Each line of the address should be in caps and small caps,
and should be centered on the one preceding. The date
should be in caps and lower case, likewise centered on those
above.)</p>
<p>51. In resolutions, the word “WHEREAS” (see 39); in
notes (not footnotes), the word “NOTE,” which
should be followed by a period and a dash; in con-
stitutions, by-laws, etc., the word “SECTION” intro-
ducing paragraphs and followed by a number:</p>
<p>NOTE. It should be noticed that ….</p>
<p>SECTION i. This association shall be styled ….</p>
<p>The usual practice is to abbreviate the word
“section” each time it is used in such a connection
except the first:</p>
<p>SECTION i. The name of the association ….
SEC. 2. The object of the association ….</p>
<p>SET IN SMALL CAPITALS</p>
<p>52. A.M. and P.M. (ante and post meridiem), and B.C.
and A.D. (“before Christ” and anno Domini); these</p>
<p>24 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>should be set without a space between (see 22,</p>
<p>103, 106, 219):</p>
<p>11:30 A.M.; 53 B.C., 1906 A.D.</p>
<p>USE SMALL (i.e., “lower-case”) INITIAL LETTER FOR</p>
<p>53. Words of common usage, originally proper names,
and their derivatives in whose present, generalized
acceptation the origin has become obscured, and
generally all verbs derived from proper names
(see i) :</p>
<p>Utopia, bohemian, philistine, titanic, platonic, quixotic,
bonanza, china, morocco, guinea-pig, boycott, roman (type),
italicize, anglicize, macadamize, paris green.</p>
<p>54. In literary references, such minor subdivisions and
their abbreviations as</p>
<p>chapter, section, page, article, verse, line, note; chap., sec.,
p., art., vs., 1., n. (See 37, no, and 237.)</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="55">
<li>Units of measurement as</li>

<p>56. In side-heads, all but the first word and proper
names (see 172 and 280).</p>
<p>57. The first word of a quotation which, through a con-
junction or otherwise, is immediately connected with
what precedes, even if such word in the original
begins a sentence.</p>
<p>For illustration and exception see 35 and 131.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: ITALICS 25</p>
<p>THE USE OF ITALICS
ITALICIZE</p>
<p>58. Words or phrases to which it is desired to lend
emphasis, importance, etc.:</p>
<p>“This was, however, not the case”; “It is sufficiently plain
that the sciences of life, at least, are studies of processes.”</p>
<p>But beware of the excessive use of italics, for the
appearance of the over-italicized page is not
pleasing and the too frequent use of italics for
emphasis weakens the text. See note to 41.</p>
<p>59. Words and phrases from foreign languages, inserted
into the English text, and not incorporated into the
English language; and also (as a rule) single sen-
tences or brief passages not of sufficient length to
call for reduced type (see 85) :</p>
<p>“the Darwinian Weltanschauung”; “Napoleon’s coup d’etat”;
“the debater par excellence of the Senate “; “De gustibus non
est disputandum, or, as the French have it, Chacun &amp; son
goto.”</p>
<p>But do not italicize foreign titles preceding names,
or names of foreign institutions or places the meaning
or position of which in English would have required
roman type, and which either are without English
equivalents or are by preference used in lieu of these:</p>

<p>60. Titles of publications books (including plays, essays,
cycles of poems, single poems of considerable length,
and symphonies, usually printed separately, and
not from the context understood to form parts of a
large volume [see 81]), pamphlets, treatises, tracts,
documents, operas, oratorios, and periodicals (in-
cluding regularly appearing proceedings and trans-
actions; and also the name of a journal appearing
in the journal itself, and the word “journal,”
“review,” etc., standing alone, if a part of the</p>

<p>Spencer, Principles of Sociology; A Midsummer-Night’s
Dream; Idylls of the King; Paradise Lost; The Messiah;
Lohengrin; the Modern Language Review, the Chicago
Tribune, the Indianapolis Star, Report of the United Slates
Commissioner of Education, Groningen Publications, No. 27.</p>
<p>NOTE. The Botanical Gazette uses italics for such titles in the
text only; in footnotes, roman. Its own name it prints in caps
and small caps BOTANICAL GAZETTE.</p>
<p>This rule may be departed from in lengthy biblio-
graphical lists, in tables, or in other matter where
to follow it would result in an undue preponder-
ance of italics (see note to 41).
Books of the Bible, both canonical and apocryphal,
and titles of ancient manuscripts should be set in
roman type, as also symbols used to designate
manuscripts (see 31 and 44) :
Psalms 53: 10, Di6, Mb, P, J.</p>
<p>61. The following words, phrases, and abbreviations
used in literary and legal references:</p>
<p>ad loc., circa (ca.), et al., ibid., idem, infra, loc. cit., op. cit.,
passim, sic, sc., supra, s.v., vide.</p>
<p>But do not italicize</p>
<p>cf., e.g., i.e., v. or vs. (versus) (unless ambiguity would
result; see note to 59), viz., etc.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: ITALICS 29</p>
<p>62. The words See and See also, when used in an index
or similar compilation, for the purpose of a cross-
reference, where the differentiation of those words
from the context is desirable ; and the words for
and read in lists of errata, to separate them from
the incorrect and correct readings:</p>
<p>See also Sociology; for levee read Iev6e.</p>
<p>63. The names of plaintiff and defendant in the citation
of legal causes; also the titles of proceedings con-
taining such prefixes as in re, ex parte, and in the
matter of, etc. :</p>
<p>Conolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co.; In re Smith; Ex parte
Brown; In the matter of the petition of Henry Robinson for a
writ of habeas corpus.</p>

<p>66. a), b), c), etc., used to indicate subdivisions (single
parenthesis if beginning a paragraph, double paren-
theses if “run in”); and a, 6, c, etc., affixed to the
number of verse, page, etc., to denote fractional part:
Luke 4:310.</p>
<p>67. Letters used to designate unknown quantities, lines,
etc., in algebraic, geometrical, and similar matter:
ac+bc=c(a+b); the lines ad and A D; the nth power.</p>
<p>68. As a rule, letters in legends or in the text referring
to corresponding letters in accompanying illustra-
tions whether or not they are in italics on the
illustration :</p>
<p>“At the point A above (see diagram).”</p>
<p>69. References to particular letters:
the letter u, a small v, a capital S.</p>
<p>But do not italicize a letter used in the place of a
name in hypothetical statements or in cases where</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: ITALICS 31</p>
<p>only the initial is used with a dash or as a simple
abbreviation :</p>
<p>“A bought land from B without registration of title”;</p>
<p>“The news was brought at once to General M “; “Mr.</p>

<p>70. s. and&lt;f. (= shillings and pence) following numerals:
3*. 6d. (See 270.)</p>
<p>71. In zoological, geological, and paleontological mat-
ter, scientific (Latin) names of genera and species
when used together, the generic name being in the
nominative singular :</p>
<p>Felis leo, Rosa Carolina, Conodectes favosus, Phyteuma
Halleri. (See 46, 48.)</p>
<p>In botanical, geological, and paleontological matter,
the names of genera and species when used together,
and of genera, only, when used alone:
Acer saccharum, Basidiobolus, Alternaria, Erythrosuchits.
In medical matter, however, the general practice
is to print such names in roman, avoiding italics
altogether.</p>
<p>In astronomical and astrophysical matter :
a) The lower-case letters designating certain
Fraunhof er lines :
a, b, g, h.</p>
<p>6) The lower-case letters used by Baeyer to desig-
nate certain stars in constellations for which the
Greek letters have been exhausted:
f Tauri, u Herculis.</p>
<p>32 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>c) When initials are used to express the titles of
catalogues, as such, and not to designate a
particular celestial object, such initials are to be
italicized (see 48, 60) :
B.D.,N.G.C.</p>
<p>d} Symbols for the chemical elements:
H, Ca, Ti.</p>
<p>In accordance with the best modern practice,
italics should no longer be used for:</p>
<p>a) The capital letters given by Fraunhofer to
spectral lines :
A-H, and K.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>The letters designating the spectral types of</li>
</ol>
<p>stars :</p>
<p>AS, 64, Mb.</p>
<p>c) The capital letter H with different Greek letters,
used to designate the various lines of hydrogen:
Ha, H/?, etc.</p>
<p>72. In resolutions, italicize the word “Resolved.” (See
39-)</p>
<p>73. After headlines or titles, as a rule, the word “Con-
tinued” ; and “To be continued” at the end of articles
(see 179) :</p>

<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: QUOTATIONS 33</p>
<p>QUOTATIONS 1</p>
<p>PUT BETWEEN QUOTATION MARKS (and in roman type
i.e., “roman-quote”) 1</p>
<p>74. Citations, run into the text, of a passage from an
author in his own words (see 85).</p>
<p>75. Quotations from different authors, or from different
works by the same author, following each other,
uninterrupted by any intervening original matter, or
by any reference to their respective sources (other
than a reference figure for a footnote), even though
such quotations are reduced (see 85-87) .</p>
<p>76. A word or phrase accompanied by its definition:
“Drop-folio” means a page-number at the foot of the page.</p>
<p>77. An unusual, technical, ironical, etc., word or phrase
in the text, whether or not accompanied by a word,
like “so-called,” directing attention to it:</p>
<p>Her “five o’ clocks” were famous in the neighborhood; She
was wearing a gown of “lobster-colored” silk; He was elected
“master of the rolls”; We then repaired to what he called
his “quarter deck”; A “lead” is then inserted between the
lines; This so-called “man of affairs.”</p>
<p>78. In translations, the English equivalent of a word,
phrase, or passage from a foreign language :
Weltanschauung, “world- view” or “fundamental aspect of
life”; Mommsen, Rimische Geschichte (“History of Rome”).</p>
<p>l ln French small angle marks are used for quotation marks; in German two
primes on one type body are used.</p>
<p>34 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>79. The particular or unusual word or words to which
attention is directed :</p>
<p>the term “lynch law”; the phrase “liberty of conscience”;
the concepts “good” and “bad”; the name “Chicago.”</p>
<p>But not in matter discussing terms or words where</p>
<p>the meaning is clear:</p>
<p>The definition of the word God.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="80">
<li>Titles of book series:</li>
</ol>
<p>“English Men of Letters Series”; “International Critical
Commentary”; the series “Handbooks of Ethics and
Religion.”</p>
<p>81. Titles of shorter poems (see 60):
Shelley’s “To a Skylark.”</p>
<p>82. Cited titles of subdivisions (e.g., parts, books, chap-
ters, etc.) of publications; titles of papers, lectures,
sermons, articles, toasts, mottoes, etc.:</p>
<p>The Beginnings of the Science of Political Economy, Vol. I,
“The British School,” chap, ii, “John Stuart Mill”; the
articles “Cross,” “Crucifixion,” and “Crusade” in Hast-
ings’ Dictionary of the Bible; The subject of the lecture was
“Japan Its Past, Present, and Future”; the next toast on
the program was “Our Canadian Visitor”; The king’s
motto is “For God and My Country.”</p>
<p>NOTE. The Botanical Gazette, in footnotes, does not use
quotation marks for such titles.</p>
<p>References to the Preface, Introduction, Table of
Contents, Index, etc., of a specific work, should be
set with capitals, without quotation marks:</p>
<p>Preface, p. iii; “The Introduction contains ….”; “The
Appendix occupies a hundred pages”; but: “The book has
a very complete index.”</p>

<p>84. Titles of pictures and works of art:
Murillo’s “The Holy Family.”</p>
<p>SET IN SMALLER TYPE</p>
<p>85. Ordinarily, all prose extracts which will make five
or more lines in the smaller type, and all poetry
citations of two lines or more. An isolated prose
quotation may properly be run into the text if it
bears an organic relation to the argument presented.
But a quotation of one or two lines which is closely
preceded or followed by longer extracts in smaller type
may be reduced as a matter of uniform appearance.</p>
<p>86. As a rule, reduce from n pt. and 10 pt. to 9 pt.,
from 9 pt. to 8 pt., from 8 pt. to 6 pt. (see 252).</p>
<p>87. Reduced citations should not have quotation marks,
except in such cases as noted in 75; nor should
quotation marks, as a rule, be used in connection
with italics.</p>
<p>GENERAL RULES</p>
<p>88. Quotation marks should always include ellipses, and
the phrase “etc.” when it otherwise would not be
clear that it stands for an omitted part of the matter
quoted, perfect clearness in each individual case
being the best criterion:</p>
<p>“Art. II, sec. 2, of the Constitution provides that ‘each state
shall appoint …. a number of electors equal to the whole
number of senators and representatives … .’”; “He also</p>
<p>36 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>wrote a series of ‘Helps to Discovery, etc.’” “etc.” here
indicating, not that he wrote other works which are unnamed,
but that the title of the one named is not given in full; but,
on the other hand: “Preaching from the text, ‘For God so</p>
<p>loved the world,’ etc ” “etc.” here being placed</p>
<p>outside of the quotation marks in order to show that it does
not stand for other, unnamed, objects of God’s love.</p>
<p>89. Quoted prose matter (i.e., matter set with quotation
marks; see above) which is broken up into para-
graphs should have the quotation marks repeated
at the beginning of each paragraph.</p>
<p>90. Where alignment is desired, the quotation marks
should be “cleared” i.e., should project beyond
the line of alignment:</p>
<p>“Keep away from dirtiness keep away from mess.
Don’t get into doin’ things rather-more-or-less ! “</p>
<p>91. Double quotation marks are used for primary quota-
tions; for a quotation within a quotation, single;
going back to double for a third, to single for a
fourth, and so on:</p>
<p>“Let me quote from Rossetti’s Life of Keats” he said.
“Mr. Rossetti writes as follows:</p>
<p>“‘To one of these phrases a few words of comment may
be given. That axiom which concludes the “Ode on a
Grecian Urn”</p>
<p>‘”“Beauty is truth, truth beauty that is all</p>
<p>Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know,”
is perhaps the most important contribution to thought
which the poetry of Keats contains: it pairs with and
transcends</p>
<p>“‘“A thing of beauty is a joy forever.”’</p>
<p>“And now I shall conclude my first point,” he continued,
“by remarking that … .”</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: SPELLING 37</p>
<p>SPELLING
SPELL OUT</p>
<p>92. All religious, civil, and military titles of honor and
respect, and forms of address, preceding the name,
except Mr., Messrs., Mrs. (French: M., MM.,
Mme, Mile), Dr., Rev., Hon., St. (do not, except
in quotations and in correspondence, set the Rev.,
the Hon.); Esq., following the name, should like-
wise always be abbreviated.</p>
<p>93. Christian names, as George, Charles, John (not:
Geo., Chas., Jno.), except where the abbreviated
form is used in quoted matter or in original signa-
tures; and “von” as part of a person’s name (see
240) ; references in text (not parenthetical or foot-
note citations) to chapters, pages, lines, figures,
etc. (See 69.)</p>
<p>94. Subject to the exceptions named at the end of this
section, in ordinary reading-matter, all numbers of
less than three digits, unless of a statistical or
technical character, or unless occurring in groups
of six or more following each other in close succes-
sion. (See 2736.)</p>
<p>“There are thirty -eight cities in the United States with a
population of 100,000 or over”; “a fifty-yard dash”; “two
pounds of sugar”; “Four horses, sixteen cows, seventy-six
sheep, and a billy goat constituted the live stock of the farm”;
“He spent a total of two years, three months, and seventeen</p>
<p>38 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>days in jail.” But: “He spent 128 days in the hospital”;
“a board 20 feet 2 inches long by i$ feet wide and ij inches
thick”; “the ratio of 16 to i”; “In some quarters of Paris,
inhabited by wealthy families, the death-rate is i to every 65
persons; in others, inhabited by the poor, it is i to 15”; “His
purchase consisted of 2 pounds of sugar, 20 pounds of flour,
i pound of coffee, pound of tea, 3 pounds of meat, and
ij pounds of fish, besides 2 pecks of potatoes and a pint of
vinegar.”</p>
<p>Treat all numbers in connected groups alike, as far
as possible; do not use figures for some and spell out
others; if the largest contains three or more digits,
use figures for all (see 96) :</p>
<p>“The force employed during the three months was 87, 93,
and 106, respectively.”</p>
<p>As a general rule, however, decimals, degrees,
dimensions, distances, enumerations, money, per-
centage, weights, and like matter should be
expressed in figures:</p>
<p>10, 45 miles, 3 cubic feet, 24 pages, 100 bushels, 9 per cent
(see 123), 45 pounds, $1,000, etc.</p>
<p>95. Round numbers (i.e., approximate figures in even
units, the unit being 100 in numbers of less than
1,000, and 1,000 in numbers of more) :</p>
<p>“The attendance was estimated at five hundred” (but: “at
550”); “a thesis of about three thousand words” (but: “of
about 2,700”); “The population of Chicago is approximately
three millions” (but: “2,900,000”). Cases like 1,500, if for
some special reason spelled out, should be written “fifteen
hundred,” not “one thousand five hundred.”</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: SPELLING 39</p>
<p>96. All numbers, no matter how high, and all terms of
measurement or number otherwise abbreviated,
commencing a sentence in ordinary reading-matter:
“Five hundred and ninety-three men, 417 women, and 126
children under eighteen, besides 63 of the crew, went down
with the ship”; “Figure 3 shows the comparative difference
in prices.”</p>
<p>When this is impracticable, or for any reason unde-
sirable, reconstruct the sentence; e.g.:
“The total number of those who went down with the ship
was 593 men,” etc.</p>
<p>97. Sums of money, when occurring in isolated cases in
ordinary reading-matter :</p>
<p>“The admission was two dollars.”
When several such numbers occur close together, and
in all matter of a statistical character, use figures:
“Admission: men, $2; women, $i; children, 25 cents.”</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="98">
<li>Time of day, in ordinary reading-matter:</li>
</ol>
<p>at four; at half-past two in the afternoon; at seven o’clock.
Statistically, in enumerations, and always in connec-
tion with A.M. and P.M., use figures:
at 4: 15 P.M. (omit “o’clock” in such connections).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="99">
<li>Ages:</li>

sessions of Congress, of military bodies, of political
divisions, of thoroughfares, and in all similar cases,
unless brevity is an important consideration (see
7, 8, and 13) :</p>

<p>102. Names of months, except in statistical matter or in
long enumerations:</p>
<p>from January i to April 15 (omit, after dates, st, d, and th).</p>
<p>103. “United States,” except in quotations and such con-
nections as: General Schofield, U.S.A.; U.S. SS.
” Oregon”; in footnotes and similar references: U.S.
Geological Survey (see 22, 52, 106).</p>
<p>104. “Railroad (-way),” and “Fort,” “Mount,” and
“Port” in geographical appellations (see 4):</p>
<p>Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad (not: R.R. orRy.);
Fort Wayne, Mount Elias, Port Huron.</p>
<p>105. In most cases, all names of publications. This rule,
like many another, is open to modification in particu-
lar instances, for expediency, nature of context,
authoritative usage, and author’s preference. Gen-
erally, if in doubt, spell out; good taste will
condone offenses in this direction more readily than
in the opposite.</p>
<p>ABBREVIATE</p>
<p>106. Names of states, territories, and possessions of the
United States following those of towns, as follows,
without space between the letters of abbrevia-
tions (see 22, 52, 103), when mentioned in lists,

<p>NOTE. In the case of hyphenated abbreviations, the first ele-

<p>GENERAL RULES</p>
<p>112. In extracts from modern authors whose spelling and
punctuation differ but slightly from ours, and where
such variations do not affect the meaning, use office
style. In citations from Old English works, and
in cases where it appears to be essential to the
writer’s plan or the requirements of the context to
give a faithful rendering, follow the original copy.
Titles should always be accurately quoted.</p>
<p>113. Form the possessive of proper names ending in s or
another sibilant, if monosyllabic, by adding an
apostrophe and s; if of more than one syllable, by
adding an apostrophe only, except names ending
in -ce (see 165) :</p>
<p>King James’s Version, Burns’s poems, Marx’s theories;
Moses’ law, Jesus’ birth, Demosthenes’ orations, Berlioz’
compositions; Horace’s odes.</p>
<p>But in the case of proper names ending in a silent
sibilant the possessive is formed by the addition</p>
<p>46 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>of the apostrophe and s, whether the word is</p>
<p>monosyllabic or not:</p>
<p>Charlevoix’s discoveries, Des Moines’s population.</p>
<p>114. Before sounded h, long u (or eu), and the words
“one,” “once,” use “a” as the form of the indefinite
article:</p>
<p>a hotel, a harmonic rendition, a historical work, a union,
a euphonious word, such a one.</p>
<p>115. The ligatures &amp; and ce are not used at the present
day, either in Latin and Greek words, or in words
adopted into English from these languages. In
English these words are written either with ae, oe,
separately, or with e alone. The ligature is re-
tained, however, in Old English and in French:</p>
<p>aetas; Oedipus Tyrannus; aesthetic; (but: ceuvre,
French); but: maneuver; Alfred (Alfred in English).</p>
<p>116. Differentiate “farther” and “further” by using the
former in the sense of “more remote,” “at a greater
distance” (with verbs of action); the latter in the
sense of “moreover,” “in addition”:</p>
<p>the farther end; he went still farther; further, he suggested; a
further reason.</p>
<p>117. In forms of address (vocative) use the “O” without
a comma following; for an exclamation use “Oh,”
followed by a comma or an exclamation point
(see 40) :</p>
<p>“O thou most mighty ruler!” “Oh, why did not Cerberus
drag me back to hell ?”</p>

<p>50 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>PUNCTUATION</p>
<p>121. All punctuation marks should be printed in the same
style or font of type as the word, letter, or character
immediately preceding them:</p>
<p>“With the cry of Banzai! the regiment stormed the hill”,
Luke 4:160; paragraph 2 (a); Botanical Gazette 20:144.</p>
<p>PERIOD</p>
<p>122. A period is used to indicate the end of a declarative
sentence (see 125).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="123">
<li><ol class="first loweralpha">
<li>Put a period after abbreviations:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Macmillan &amp; Co., Mr. Smith, St. Paul, No. i, Chas. (see
93), ibid., s.v., ip mm., 1201 E. Main St., SE. J of SW. J,
T. 3 N., R. 69 W., Sec. n, middle of S. line, N.NE. (north
by northeast) .</p>
<p>V) Do not use a period after contractions cases
where a mechanical necessity compels the omission
of a letter or letters in the middle of a word for which
there is no recognized abbreviated form; such omis-
sion is indicated by an apostrophe:
m’f ‘g pl’t ( = manufacturing plant) ; ‘t isn’t.
c) Treat the metric symbols as abbreviations, but
not the chemical symbols, nor the phrase “per
cent,” nor the format of books:
O, Fe; 2 per cent (see 94); 4to, 8vo.</p>
<p>NOTE. With respect to symbols for measures the following
exceptions should be noted: Astrophysical Journal, 12 mm (with
thin space and no period) (but: 2 h 3 m 4 s ); Botanical Gazette,
i2mm., i25ft.,9cc. (on line, with period).</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 51</p>
<p>But do not use a period, in technical matter, after the
recognized abbreviations for linguistic epochs, or
for titles of well-known publications of which the
initials only are given, nor after MS (= manuscript),
nor after Mme and Mile in French (see 92) :
IE (=Indo-European), OE (= Old English), MHG (=Middle
High German); AJSL (= American Journal of Semitic
Languages and Literatures), ZAW (=Zeitschrijt filr alttesta-
mentliche Wissenschaff), CIL (= Cor pus Inscriptionum Lati-
norum), PMLA (= Publications of the Modern Language
Association}.</p>
<p>124. Use no period after Roman numerals, even if having
the value of ordinals:</p>
<p>Vol. IV; Louis XVI was on the throne.</p>
<p>125. Omit the period after running-heads (for explanation
of this and the following terms see 279-83); after
centered headlines; after side-heads set in separate
lines; after cut-in heads; after box-heads in tables;
and after superscriptions and legends which do not
form a complete sentence (with subject and predi-
cate), or which do not make more than a single line
of type; after date lines at top of communications,
and after signatures (see 50) .</p>
<p>126. The period is always placed inside the quotation
marks; and inside the parentheses when the matter
inclosed is an independent sentence and forms no
part of the preceding sentence; otherwise outside:</p>
<p>Tennyson’s “In Memoriam.” Put the period inside the
quotation marks. (This is a rule without exception.) When
tie parentheses form part of the preceding sentence, put
the period outside (as, for instance, here).</p>
<p>52 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>EXCLAMATION POINT</p>
<p>127. The exclamation point is used to mark an outcry, or
an emphatic or ironical utterance:</p>
<p>“Long live the king!” “Heaven forbid!” “Good!” he
cried; “How funny this seems!” “This must not be!” The
subject of his lecture was “The Thisness of the That”! The
speaker went on: “Nobody should leave his home tomorrow
without a marked ballot in their (!) pocket.”</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="128">
<li>The exclamation point is placed inside the quotation</li>
</ol>
<p>marks or parentheses when part of the quotation
or parenthetical matter; otherwise outside.
See illustrations in 127.</p>
<p>INTERROGATION POINT</p>
<p>129. The interrogation point is used to mark a query, or
to express a doubt:</p>
<p>“Who is this ?” The prisoner gave his name as Roger Crown-
inshield, the son of an English baronet ( ?). Can the Bible
be applied to children ? is a question involved.</p>
<p>In Spanish the question mark is expressed before
as well as after the question, but the mark that
precedes is inverted.</p>
<p>Indirect questions should not be followed by an
interrogation point:
She asked whether he was ill.</p>
<p>A technically interrogative sentence disguised as
a question out of courtesy but actually embody-
ing a request does not need the interrogation
point:
Will you kindly sign and return the inclosed card.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 53</p>
<p>130. The interrogation point should be placed inside the
quotation marks or parentheses only when it is a
part of the quotation or parenthetical matter:</p>
<p>“Take hold, my son, of the toughest knots in life and try
to untie them; try to be worthy of man’s highest estate;
have high, noble, manly honor. There is but one test of
everything, and that is, Is it right?” (Henry A. Wise).
The question: “Who is who, and what is what?” Were
you ever in “Tsintsinnati” ?</p>
<p>COLON</p>
<p>131. The colon is used to “mark a discontinuity of
grammatical construction greater than that indicated
by the semicolon and less than that indicated by the
period. It is commonly used (i) to emphasize a
close connection in thought between two clauses
each of which forms a complete sentence, and which
might with grammatical propriety be separated by
a period; (2) to separate a clause which is gram-
matically complete from a second which contains
an illustration or amplification of its meaning; (3)
to introduce a formal statement, an extract, a speech
in a dialogue, etc.” (Century Dictionary] (unless
this is preceded by a conjunction, like “that,”
immediately connecting it with what goes before).
Before the quotation of a clause in the middle of a
sentence use a comma:</p>
<p>(i) “This argument undeniably contains some force: Thus
it is well known that …” “The secretion of the gland</p>
<p>54 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>goes on uninterruptedly: this may account for the condition
of the organ.” “The fear of death is universal: even the
lowest animals instinctively shrink from annihilation.” (2)
“Most countries have a national flower: France the lily,
England the rose, etc.” “Lambert pine: the gigantic sugar
pine of California.” (3) “The rule may be stated thus:
… .” “We quote from the address: … .” “Charles:
‘Where are you going?’ George: ‘To the mill-pond.’”
But: “He stoutly maintained that ‘the letter is a monstrous
forgery’”; and: “Declaring, ‘The letter is a monstrous
forgery,’ he tried to wash his hands of the whole affair.”</p>
<p>132. The colon thus often takes the place of an implied
“namely,” “as follows,” “for instance,” or a similar
phrase. Where such word or phrase is used, it
should be followed by a colon if what follows consists
of one or more grammatically complete clauses
(see 36) ; otherwise by a comma (see 145) :</p>
<p>“This is true of only two nations the wealthiest, though not
the largest, in Europe: Great Britain and France”; but:
“This is true of only two nations the wealthiest, though
not the largest, in Europe viz., Great Britain and France.”
“He made several absurd statements. For example: ….”;
but: “There are several states in the Union for instance,
Kansas and Wyoming which … .”</p>
<p>133. Put a colon after the salutatory phrase at the begin-
ning of a letter and after the introductory remark
of a speaker addressing the chairman or the audi-
ence:</p>
<p>MY DEAR MR. BROWN: (See 50.)</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: (See 64.)</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 55</p>
<p>134. Put a centered (g-unit) colon between chapter and
verse in Scripture passages, between hours and
minutes in time indications, and between volume
and page reference when such style is used:
Matt. 2:5-13; 4:30 P.M.; Botanical Gazette 20:144.</p>
<p>135. Put a colon between the place of publication and the
publisher’s name in literary and bibliographical
references :</p>
<p>Clement of Alexandria (London: Macmillan), II, 97.</p>
<p>136. The colon should be placed outside the quotation
marks, unless a part of the quotation:</p>
<p>He writes under the head of “Notes and Comments”:
” Many a man can testify to the truth of the old adage :” etc.</p>
<p>SEMICOLON</p>
<p>137. A semicolon is used to mark the division of a
sentence somewhat more independent than that
marked by a comma, or to separate complete
statements the argument of which is dependent
upon their remaining in the same sentence:</p>
<p>“Are we giving our lives to perpetuate the things that the
past has created for its needs, forgetting to ask whether these
things still serve today’s needs; or are we thinking of living
men ?” “This is as important for science as it is for practice;
indeed, it may be said to be the only important consideration.”
“It is so in war; it is so in the economic life; it cannot be
otherwise in religion.” “In Persia the final decision rests with
the Shah, advised by his ministers; in most constitutional
countries, indirectly with the people as represented in parlia-
ment; in Switzerland alone, through the referendum, directly
with the electorate at large.’’ “This, let it be remembered,</p>
<p>56 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>was the ground taken by Mill; for to him ‘utilitarianism,’
in spite of all his critics may say, did not mean the pursuit of
bodily pleasure.” (“For” in such cases should commonly be
preceded by a semicolon.)</p>
<p>138. In enumerations use a semicolon between the differ-
ent links, if these consist of more than a few words
closely connected, and especially if individual clauses
contain any punctuation mark of less value than a
period, or an exclamation or interrogation point
(unless inclosed in parentheses), yet are intimately
joined one with the other, and all with the sentence
or clause leading up to them, for instance through
dependence upon a conjunction, like “that,” pre-
ceding them (see 36) :</p>
<p>“The membership of the international commission was made
up as follows: France, 4; Germany, 5; Great Britain, i
(owing to a misunderstanding, the announcement did not
reach the English societies in time to secure a full quota from
that country. Sir Henry Campbell, who had the matter in
charge, being absent at the time, great difficulty was experi-
enced in arousing sufficient interest to insure the sending of
even a solitary delegate); Italy, 3; the United States, 7.”
“The defendant, in justification of his act, pleaded that (i)
he was despondent over the loss of his wife; (2) he was out
of work; (3) he had had nothing to eat for two days; (4) he
was under the influence of liquor.” “Presidents Hadley, of
Yale; Eliot, of Harvard; Butler, of Columbia; and Angell,
of Michigan.”</p>
<p>139. In Scripture references a semicolon is used to
separate passages containing chapters:</p>
<p>Gen. 2:3-6, 9, 14; 3:17; chap. 5; 6:15.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 57</p>
<p>140. The semicolon should be placed outside the quota-
tion marks or parentheses, unless a part of the
quotation or parenthetical matter.</p>
<p>COMMA</p>
<p>141. The comma is “used to indicate the smallest inter-
ruptions in continuity of thought or grammatical
construction, the marking of which contributes to
clearness” (Century Dictionary)’.</p>
<p>“Here, as in many other cases, what is sometimes popularly
supposed to be orthodox is really a heresy, an exaggeration,
a distortion, a caricature of the true doctrine of the church.
The doctrine is, indeed, laid down by an authority here and
there; but, speaking generally, it has no place in the stand-
ards, creeds, or confessions of the great communions; e.g.,
the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, the canons of the early
ecumenical councils, the Westminster Confession, the Thirty-
nine Articles.” “Shakspere and other, lesser, poets.” “The
books which I have read I herewith return” (i.e., I return
those [only] which I have read); but: “The books, which I
have read, I herewith return” (i.e., having read them [all],
I now return them). “Gossiping, women are happy”; and:
“Gossiping women are happy.” “Of these four, two Ameri-
cans and one Englishman started”; and: “Of these, four
two Americans and two Englishmen started.” “The suffer-
ing, God will relieve.” “Behind, her ‘stage mother’ stood
fluttering with extra wraps.” “Some boys and girls pre-
maturely announce themselves, usually in uncomfortable,
sometimes in bad, ways.”</p>
<p>142. Use a comma to separate proper nouns belonging
to different individuals or places:</p>
<p>“To John, Smith was always kind”; “To America, Europe
awards the prize of mechanical skill.”</p>
<p>58 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>143. Put a comma before “and,” “or,” and “nor”
connecting the last two links in a sequence of three
or more; or all the links in a series of greater length,
or where each individual link consists of several
words; always put a comma before “etc.”:</p>
<p>Tom, Dick, and Harry; either copper, silver, or gold; “He
was equally familiar with Homer, and Shakspere, and
Moliere, and Cervantes, and Goethe, and Ibsen”; “Neither
France for her art, nor Germany for her army, nor England
for her democracy, etc.”</p>
<p>But do not use a comma where “and,” etc., serves
to connect all of the links in a brief and close-knit
phrase :</p>
<p>“a man good and noble and true”; “I do not remember who
wrote the stanza whether it was Shelley or Keats or Moore.”</p>
<p>144. Ordinarily, put a comma before and after clauses in-
troduced by such conjunctions as “and,” “but,” “or,”
“if,” “while,” “as” (meaning “since”), “whereas,”
“since,” “because,” “when,” “after,” “although,”
etc., especially if a change of subject takes place:</p>
<p>“When he arrived at the railway station, the train had gone,
and his friend, who had come to bid him goodbye, had
departed, but left no word. As the next train was not due
for two hours, he decided to take a ride about the town,
although it offered little of interest to the sightseer. While
he regretted his failure to meet his friend, he did not go
to his house.”</p>
<p>But do not use a comma before clauses introduced
by such conjunctions if the preceding clause is not</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 59</p>
<p>logically complete without them; nor before “if,”
“but,” and “though” in brief and close-welded
phrases:</p>
<p>“This is especially interesting because they represent the two
extremes and because they present differences in their rela-
tions”; “This is good because true”; “I shall agree to this
only if you accept my conditions”; “I would not if I could,
and could not if I would”; “honest though poor”; “a cheap
but valuable book.”</p>
<p>145. Such conjunctions, adverbs, connective particles, or
phrases as “now,” “then,” “however,” “indeed,”
“therefore,” “moreover,” “furthermore,” “never-
theless,” “though,” “in fact,” “in short,” “for
instance,” “that is,” “of course,” “on the contrary,”
“on the other hand,” “after all,” “to be sure,”
“for example,” etc., may be followed by a comma
when standing at the beginning of a sentence or
clause to introduce an inference or an explanation,
and may be placed between commas when wedged
into the middle of a sentence or clause to mark off a
distinct break in the continuity of thought or struc-
ture, indicating a summarizing of what precedes,
the point of a new departure, or a modifying, restrict-
ive, or antithetical addition, etc. :</p>
<p>“Indeed, this was exactly the point of the argument”;
“Moreover, he did not think it feasible”; “Now, the question
is this: … .” “Nevertheless, he consented to the scheme”;
“In fact, rather thi reverse is true”; “This, then, is my
position: … .”; “The statement, therefore, cannot be
verified”; “He thought, however, that he would like to</p>
<p>60 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>try”; “That, after all, seemed a trivial matter”; “The
gentleman, of course, was wrong”; “A comma may be used
between clauses of a compound sentence that are connected
by a simple con junction, though a comma is emphatically not
used between clauses connected by a conjunctive adverb.”</p>
<p>But do not use a comma with such words when the
connection is logically close and structurally smooth
enough not to call for any pause in reading; with
“therefore,” “nevertheless,” etc., when directly
following the verb; with “indeed” when directly
preceding or following an adjective or another
adverb which it qualifies; nor ordinarily with such
terms as “perhaps,” “also,” “likewise,” etc.:</p>
<p>“Therefore I say unto you … .”; “He was therefore
unable to be present”; “It is nevertheless true”; “He is
recovering very slowly indeed”; “He was perhaps thinking
of the future”; “He was a scholar and a sportsman too.”</p>
<p>146. A comma is preferably omitted before “rather” in
such an expression as</p>
<p>“The time-value is to be measured in this way rather than
by the time-equivalent of the strata.”</p>
<p>147. If among several adjectives preceding a noun the
last bears a more direct relation to the noun than the
others, it should not be preceded by a comma:</p>
<p>“the admirable political institutions of the country”; “a hand-
some, wealthy young man.”</p>
<p>148. Participial clauses, especially such as contain an
explanation of the main clause, should usually be
set off by a comma :</p>
<p>“Being asleep, he did not hear him”; “Exhausted by a day’s
hard work, he slept like a stone.”</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 6 1</p>
<p>149. Put a comma before “not” introducing an anti-
thetical clause or phrase:</p>
<p>“Men addict themselves to inferior pleasures, not because
they deliberately prefer them, but because they are the only
ones to which they have access.”</p>
<p>But do not use commas before such words when the
thought is incomplete without the following words.</p>
<p>150. For parenthetical, adverbial, or appositional clauses
or phrases use commas to indicate structurally
disconnected, but logically integral, interpolations;
dashes to indicate both structurally and logically
disconnected insertions ; never use the two together
(see 175):</p>
<p>“Since, from the naturalistic point of view, mental states are
the concomitants of physiological processes … .”; “The
French, generally speaking, are a nation of artists”; “The
English, highly democratic as they are, nevertheless deem
the nobility fundamental to their political and social systems.”
“There was a time I forget the exact date when these
conditions were changed.”</p>
<p>151. Use a comma to separate two identical or closely
similar words, even if the sense or grammatical con-
struction does not require such separation (see 142) :</p>
<p>“Whatever is, is good”; “What he was, is not known”;
“The chief aim of academic striving ought not to be, to be
most in evidence “; “This is unique only in this, that … .”</p>
<p>152. In adjectival phrases a complementary, qualifying,
delimiting, or antithetical adjective added to the
main epithet preceding a noun should ordinarily be
preceded and followed by a comma:</p>
<p>62 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>“This harsh, though at the same time perfectly logical,
conclusion”; “The deceased was a stern and unapproach-
able, yet withal sympathetic and kind-hearted, gentleman ” ;
“Here comes in the most responsible, because it is the final,
office of the teacher”; “The most sensitive, if not the most
elusive, part of the training of children”; “The better a
proverb is, the more trite it usually becomes.”</p>
<p>153. Two or more co-ordinate clauses ending in a word
governing or modifying another word in a following
clause should be separated by commas :</p>
<p>“… . a shallow body of water connected with, but well
protected from, the open sea”; “He was as tall as, though
much younger than, his brother”; “The cultivation in our-
selves of a sensitive feeling on the subject of veracity is one of
the most useful, and the enfeeblement of that feeling one of
the most hurtful, things”; “This road leads away from,
rather than toward, your destination.”</p>
<p>154. Similarly, use a comma to separate two numbers:
“In 1905, 347 teachers attended the convention”; November
i, 1905. (See 160.)</p>
<p>155. A comma is employed to indicate the omission, for
brevity or convenience, of a word or words the
repetition of which is not essential to the meaning :
“In Illinois there are seventeen such institutions; in Ohio,
twenty-two; in Indiana, thirteen” ; “In Lincoln’s first cabinet
Seward was secretary of state; Chase, of the treasury;
Cameron, of war; and Bates, attorney general.”</p>
<p>Often, however, such constructions are smooth enough
not to call for commas (and consequent semicolons) :
“One puppy may resemble the father, another the mother,
and a third some distant ancestor.”</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 63</p>
<p>156. A direct quotation, maxim, or similar expression,
when brief, should be separated from the preceding
part of the sentence by a comma (see 131) :</p>
<p>” God said, Let there be light.”</p>
<p>157. Use a comma before “of” in connection with resi-
dence or position:</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Mclntyre, of Detroit, Mich.; President Hadley,
of Yale University.</p>
<p>Exceptions are those cases, historical and political, in
which the place-name practically has become a part
of the person’s name, or is so closely connected with
this as to render the separation artificial or illogical:</p>
<p>Clement of Alexandria, Philip of Anjou, King Edward of
England.</p>
<p>158. In literary references insert a comma between con-
secutive numbers to represent a break in the con-
tinuity, a separate reference to each; an en dash, to
represent one continuous reference between the
consecutive numbers:</p>
<p>pp. 4, 7-8, 10; Ezra 5:7-8; IV, 123-30.</p>
<p>159. Put a comma after digits indicating thousands, 1
except in a date or in a page-reference and not
between the constituents of dimensions, weights,
and measures:</p>
<p>1,276, 10,419; 2200 B.C.; p. 2461; 3 feet 6 inches; 4 Ib.
2 oz. ; 2 hr. 4 min.</p>
<p>NOTE. Astrophysical Journal and Botanical Gazette do not
use a comma with four figures.</p>
<p>1 Except in German and in Spanish, where a period is used instead, as: 69.190.175 .</p>
<p>64 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>160. Separate month and year and similar time divisions
by a comma:</p>
<p>November, 1905 ; New Year’s Day, 1906.</p>
<p>NOTE. Astrophysical Journal and Botanical Gazette do not
use a comma between month and year.</p>
<p>161. Omit the comma, in signatures and at the beginning
of articles, after author’s name followed by address,
title, or position in a separate line, or after address
followed by a date line, etc. (see 65).</p>
<p>162. The comma is always placed inside the quotation
marks, but following the parenthesis, if the con-
text requires it at all.</p>
<p>APOSTROPHE</p>
<p>163. An apostrophe is used to mark the omission of a
letter or letters in the contraction of a word, or of
figures in a number. In the case of contractions
containing a verb and the negative, do not use space
between the two components of the contraction:</p>
<p>it’s, ne’er, ‘twas, “takin’ me ‘at”; m’f’g; the class of ‘96;
don’t, haven’t. (See 123.)</p>
<p>164. The possessive case of nouns, common and proper,
is formed by the addition of an apostrophe, or
apostrophe and 5 (see 113) :</p>
<p>a man’s word, horses’ tails; Scott’s Ivanhoe, Jones’s farms,
Themistodes’ era; for appearance’ sake.</p>
<p>165. The plural of numerals, and of rare or artificial noun-
coinages, is formed by the aid of an apostrophe and
s; of proper nouns of more than one syllable ending
in a sibilant, by adding an apostrophe alone (mono-</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 65</p>
<p>syllabic proper names ending in a sibilant add es;
others, s) (see 101) :</p>
<p>in the i goo’s; in two’s and three’s, the three R’s, the
Y.M.C.A.’s; “these I-just-do-as-I-please’s”; “all the Tommy
Atkins’ of England” (but: the Rosses and the Macdougals);
the Pericles’ and Socrates’ of literature.</p>
<p>QUOTATION MARKS. (See section on “Quotations,”
74-91.)</p>
<p>DASHES</p>
<p>166. An em dash is used to denote “a sudden break,
stop, or transition in a sentence, or an abrupt change
in its construction, a long or significant pause, or
an unexpected or epigrammatic turn of sentiment”
(John Wilson) :</p>
<p>“Do we can we send out educated boys and girls from the
high school at eighteen ?” “The Platonic world of the static,
and the Hegelian world of process how great the contrast!”
” ‘Process’ that is the magic word of the modern period”;
“To be or not to be that is the question”; “Christianity
found in the Roman Empire a civic life which was implicated
by a thousand roots with pagan faith and cultus a state
which offered little.”</p>
<p>167. Use dashes (rarely parentheses see 177) for par-
enthetical clauses which are both logically and
structurally independent interpolations (see 150):</p>
<p>“This may be said to be but, never mind, we will pass over
that”; “There came a time let us say, for convenience, with
Herodotus and Thucydides when this attention to actions
was conscious and deliberate”; “If it be asked and in say-
ing this I but epitomize my whole contention why the
Mohammedan religion … .”</p>
<p>66 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>1 68. A clause added to lend emphasis to, or to explain or
expand, a word or phrase occurring in the main
clause, which word or phrase is then repeated,
should be introduced by a dash:</p>
<p>“To him they are more important as the sources for history
the history of events and ideas”; “Here we are face to face
with a new and difficult problem new and difficult, that is,
in the sense that … . “</p>
<p>169. Wherever a “namely” is implied before a paren-
thetical or complementary clause, a dash should
preferably be used (see 132) :</p>
<p>“These discoveries gunpowder, printing-press, compass,
and telescope were the weapons before which the old science
trembled”; “But here we are trenching upon another division
of our field the interpretation of New Testament books.”</p>
<p>170. In sentences broken up into clauses, the final
summarizing clause should be preceded by a dash :</p>
<p>“Amos, with the idea that Jehovah is an upright judge
… . ; Hosea, whose Master hated injustice and falsehood
… . ; Isaiah, whose Lord would have mercy only on those
who relieved the widow and the fatherless these were the
spokesmen … ‘</p>
<p>171. a) A word or phrase set in a separate line and suc-
ceeded by paragraphs, at the beginning of each of
which it is implied, should be followed by a dash :</p>
<p>“I recommend</p>
<p>” i. That we kill him.</p>
<p>“2. That we flay him.”</p>
<p>6) In French and in Spanish a dash is used before
a speech in direct discourse instead of quotation
marks before and after.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 67</p>
<p>172. A dash may be used in connection with side-heads,
whether “run in” or paragraphed:</p>
<p>2. The language of the New Testament. The lexicons
of Grimm-Thayer, Cremer, and others ….</p>
<p>NOTE. The above has been taken from ….</p>
<p>Biblical criticism in other denominations</p>
<p>A most interesting article appeared in the Expository
Times ….</p>
<p>173. Use a dash in place of the word “to” connecting
two words or numbers (see 158) :</p>
<p>May- July, 1906 (en dash); May i, 1905 November i, 1906
(em dash); pp. 3-7 (en dash); Luke 3:6 5:2 (em dash).</p>
<p>But if the word “from” precedes the first word or
number, do not use the dash instead of “to”:</p>
<p>From May i to July i, 1906.</p>
<p>In connecting consecutive numbers omit hundreds
from the second number i.e., use only two figures
unless the first number ends in two ciphers, in
which case repeat; if the next to the last figure in
the first number is a cipher, do not repeat this in the
second number; but in citing dates B.C. always
repeat the hundreds (because representing a dimi-
nution, not an increase) (see 158) :</p>
<p>1880-95, PP- 1I 3~ 1 ^’, 1900-1906, pp. 102-7; 387-324 B.C.</p>
<p>NOTE. The Astrophysical Journal and Botanical Gazette re-
peat the hundreds’ 1880-1895, pp. 113-116.</p>
<p>68 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>174. Let a dash precede the reference (author, title of
work, or both) following a direct quotation, consisting
of at least one complete sentence, in footnotes or
cited independently in the text (see 85) :</p>
<p>1 “I felt an emotion of the moral sublime at beholding
such an instance of civic heroism.” Thirty Years, I, 379.
The green grass is growing,</p>
<p>The morning wind is in it,
‘Tis a tune worth the knowing
Though it change every minute.</p>
<p>Emerson, “To Ellen, at the South.”</p>
<p>175. A dash should not ordinarily be used in connection
with any other point, except a period :</p>
<p>“DEAR SIR: I have the honor … .”; not: “DEAR SIR:
I have … .”; “This I say it with regret was not done”;
not: “This, I say it with regret, was … .”</p>
<p>But in a sentence where a comma would be neces-
sary if the parenthetical clause set off by dashes
did not exist, the comma may be retained before
the first dash:</p>
<p>Darwin, the promulgator of the theory, though by no
means its only supporter is regarded today, etc.</p>
<p>And when the parenthetical clause set off by dashes
itself requires an interrogation or exclamation
point, such punctuation may be retained in con-
nection with the second dash:</p>
<p>Senator Blank shall we call him statesman or politician ?
introduced the bill; If the ship should sink which God
forbid! he will be a ruined man.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 69</p>
<p>PARENTHESES</p>
<p>176. Place between parentheses figures or letters used to
mark divisions in enumerations run into the text:</p>
<p>“The reasons for his resignation were three: (i) advanced
age, (2) failing health, (3) a desire to travel.”</p>
<p>If such divisions are paragraphed, a single paren-
thesis is ordinarily used in connection with a lower-
case (italic) letter; a period, with figures and capital
(roman) letters. In syllabi, and matter of a similar
character, the following scheme of notation and
indention should ordinarily be adhered to:</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Under the head of ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperroman simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<p>ii) Under ….
(ft) Under ….</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="2">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="2">
<li>Under the head of ….</li>
</ol>
<p>177. Parentheses should not ordinarily be used for paren-
thetical clauses (see 150 and 167) unless confusion
might arise from the use of less distinctive marks, or</p>
<p>70 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>unless the content of the clause is wholly irrelevant
to the main argument:</p>
<p>“He meant I take this to be the (somewhat obscure) sense
of his speech that … .”; “The period thus inaugurated
(of which I shall speak at greater length in the next chapter)
was characterized by ….”; “The contention has been
made (op. cit.) that … .”</p>
<p>BRACKETS</p>
<p>178. Brackets are used (i) to inclose an explanation or
note, (2) to indicate an interpolation in a quotation,
(3) to rectify a mistake, (4) to supply an omission,
and (5) for parentheses within parentheses:</p>
<p>(1) ‘ [This was written before the publication of Spencer’s
book. EDITOR.]</p>
<p>(2) “These [the free-silver Democrats] asserted that the
present artificial ratio can be maintained indefinitely.”</p>
<p>(3) “As the Italian [Englishman] Dante Gabriel Ros-
[s]etti has said, … .”</p>

of Letters,” III.] London: Black, 1900.</p>
<p>(5) Grote, the great historian of Greece (see his History,
I, 204 [second edition] ),….</p>
<p>179. Such phrases as “To be continued” at the end, and
“Continued from … .” at the beginning, of
articles, chapters, etc., should be placed between
brackets, centered, and set in italics (see 73) and in
type reduced in size in accordance with the rule
governing reductions (see 86) :</p>
<p>[Continued from p. 320]
[To be concluded]</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 71</p>
<p>ELLIPSES</p>
<p>180. Ellipses are used to indicate the omission, from a
quotation, of one or more words not essential to
the idea which it is desired to convey, and also
to indicate illegible words, mutilations, and other
lacunae in a document, manuscript, or other mate-
rial which is quoted. For an ellipsis at the begin-
ning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence four
periods, separated by a space (en quad), should
ordinarily be used, except in very narrow measures
(in French three only, with no space between).
If the preceding line ends in a point, this should
not be included in the four. Where a “whole para-
graph, or paragraphs, or, in poetry, a complete
line, or lines, are omitted, insert a full line of
periods, separated by em- or 2-em quads, according
to the length of the line. But the periods should not
extend beyond the length of the longest type-line:</p>
<p>The point … . is that the same forces …. are still</p>
<p>the undercurrents of every human life We may</p>
<p>never unravel the methods of the physical forces; …..
but ….</p>
<p>I think it worth giving you these details, because it is
a vague thing, though a perfectly true thing, to say that it

<p>vast number of men ….</p>
<p>“Aux armes! … aux armes! … les Prussiens!”</p>
<p>“Je n’ecris que ce que j’ai vu, entendu, senti ou eprouve</p>
<p>moi-me’me … j’ai deja publie quelques petits ouvrages …”</p>
<p>72 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>181. An ellipsis should be treated as a part of the citation;
consequently should be inclosed in the quotation
marks (see 178 [3]).</p>
<p>HYPHENS</p>
<p>182. A hyphen is placed at the end of a line the remainder
of the last word of which is carried to the next line
(see section on “Divisions”) and between many
compound words. The modern tendency is in favor
of writing as one two words which, when united,
convey but one idea:</p>
<p>schoolroom, workshop, headquarters.</p>
<p>Thus far, however, this practice is only a tendency;
there are many compound words which are better
hyphenated than consolidated. The following
rules are designed to cover such cases, but it must
be remembered that they are not to be applied
in all cases, and that a certain degree of judgment
must be exercised in their use.</p>
<p>183. Hyphenate two or more words (except proper names
forming a unity in themselves) combined into one
adjective preceding a noun, or into one pronoun.</p>
<p>so-called Croesus, well-known author, first-class investment,
better-trained teachers, high-school course, half-dead horse,
much-mooted question, joint-stock company, English-speaking
peoples, nineteenth-century progress, white-rat serum, up-to-
date machinery, four-year-old boy, house-to-house canvass,
go-as-you-please fashion, deceased-wife’s-sister bill; the
feeble-minded (person) ; but : New Testament times, Old
English spelling, an a priori argument.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 73</p>
<p>Do not hyphenate combinations of adverb and
adjective where no ambiguity could result:
an ever increasing flood.</p>
<p>Where one of the components contains more than</p>
<p>one word, an en dash should be used in place of a</p>
<p>hyphen:</p>
<p>New York-Chicago freight traffic, Norwegian-German-</p>
<p>Jewish immigrant.</p>
<p>But do not connect by a hyphen adjectives or par-
ticiples with adverbs ending in “-ly”; nor such
combinations as the foregoing when following the
noun, or qualifying a predicate:
highly developed species; a man well known in the neighbor-
hood; the fly-leaf, so called; “Her gown and carriage were
strictly up to date.”</p>
<p>184. Hyphenate, as a rule, nouns formed by the combina-
tion of two nouns standing in objective relation to
each other that is, one of whose components is
derived from a transitive verb:</p>
<p>mind-reader, story-teller, fool-killer, office-holder, well-wisher,
property-owner; hero-worship, wood-turning, clay-modeling,
curriculum -making.</p>
<p>Exceptions are common and brief compounds, un-
wieldy formations, or compounds with a special
meaning:</p>
<p>lawgiver, taxpayer, proofreader, bookkeeper, stockholder,
freehand, schoolboy, schoolgirl (but: school man, to dis-
tinguish from the Schoolmen of the Middle Ages) ; encyclo-
pedia compiler; waterproof, concussionproof.</p>
<p>74 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>185. A present participle united (i) with a noun to forma
new noun with a meaning different from that which
would be conveyed by the two words taken separately,
(2) with a preposition used absolutely (i.e., not gov-
erning a following noun), to form a noun, may
properly take a hyphen :</p>
<p>boarding-house, dining-hall, sleeping-room, dwelling-place,
printing-office, walking-stick, starting-point, stepping-
stone, stumbling-block (but meeting place) ; lean-to.</p>
<p>186. As a general rule, compounds of “book,” “house,”
“mill,” “room,” “shop,” and “work” should be
printed as one compact word, without a hyphen,
when the prefixed noun contains only one syllable,
should be hyphenated when it contains two, and
should be printed as two separate words when it
contains three or more:</p>
<p>handbook, schoolbook, notebook, textbook; pocket-book,</p>
<p>story-book; reference book.</p>
<p>boathouse, clubhouse, schoolhouse, storehouse; engine-house,</p>
<p>power-house; business house.</p>
<p>commill, handmill, sawmill, windmill; water-mill, paper-mill;</p>
<p>chocolate mill.</p>
<p>bedroom, classroom, schoolroom, storeroom; lecture-room;</p>
<p>recitation room; but: drawing-room (sitting-room) ; drawing</p>
<p>room (for lessons) .</p>
<p>tinshop, workshop; bucket-shop, tailor-shop; policy shop;</p>
<p>handwork, woodwork; metal-work; filigree work.</p>
<p>Exceptions are rare combinations, and such as for
appearance’ sake would better be separated:
wheat mill, school work, home work, class work, book
work, team work, source book.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 75</p>
<p>187. Compounds of “maker,” “dealer,” and other words
denoting occupation should ordinarily be hyphen-
ated; likewise nouns combined in an adjectival
sense before a proper noun:</p>
<p>harness-maker, book-dealer, (see 184); a soldier-statesman,
the poet-artist Rossetti. (Exceptions are a few short
words of everyday occurrence: bookmaker, dressmaker,
shopgirl.)</p>
<p>188. Compounds of “store” should be hyphenated when
the prefix contains only one syllable; otherwise not:</p>
<p>drug-store, feed-store (but: bookstore); grocery store, dry-
goods store.</p>
<p>189. Compounds of “fellow” are hyphenated when
forming the first element of the compound:</p>
<p>fellow-man, fellow-beings; but: playfellow; “Mr. Good-
fellow”; politics makes strange bedfellows.</p>
<p>190. Compounds of “father,” “mother,” “brother,”
“sister,” “daughter,” “parent,” and “foster” should
be hyphenated when forming the first element of
the compound:</p>
<p>father-love (but: fatherland), mother- tongue, brother-officer,
sister-nation, foster-son, daughter-cells, parent-word.</p>
<p>191. Compounds of “great,” indicating the fourth degree
in a direct line of descent, call for a hyphen:
great-grandfather, great-grandson.</p>
<p>1 92. Compounds of ” life ” and ” world ” require a hyphen :</p>
<p>life-history, life-principle (but: lifetime), world-power, world-
problem.</p>
<p>76 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>193. Compounds of “skin” with words of one syllable
are to be printed as one word; with words of more
than one, as two separate words:</p>
<p>calfskin, sheepskin; alligator skin.</p>
<p>194. Compounds of “master” should be hyphenated:
master-builder, master-stroke (exception: masterpiece).</p>
<p>195. Compounds of “god,” when this word forms
the second element of the compound, should be
hyphenated:</p>
<p>sun-god, rain-god (but: godsend, godson).</p>
<p>196. “Half,” “quarter,” etc., combined with a noun
should be followed by a hyphen:</p>
<p>half-truth, half- tone; half-year, half-title, quarter-mile; but
not the adverb “halfway.”</p>
<p>197. “Semi-,” “demi-,” “bi-,” “tri-,” etc., do not ordina-
rily demand a hyphen, unless followed by i, w, or y:</p>
<p>semiannual, demigod, bipartisan, bichromate, bimetallist,
trimonthly, tricolor, trifoliate, semi-incandescent, bi-
weekly, tri-yearly.</p>
<p>Exceptions are long or unusual formations:
semi-barbarous, semi-translucent.</p>
<p>198. Compounds of “self,” when this word forms the
first element of the compound, are hyphenated:
self-evident, self-respect.</p>
<p>199. Combinations with “fold” are to be printed as one
word if the number contains only one syllable; if it
contains more, as two:</p>
<p>twofold, tenfold; fifteen fold, a hundred fold.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 77</p>
<p>200. Adjectives formed by the suffixation of “like” to
a noun are usually printed as one word if the noun
contains only one syllable (except when ending in
/); if it contains more (or is a proper noun), they
should be hyphenated:</p>
<p>childlike, homelike, warlike, godlike; eel-like, bell-like;
woman-like, business-like; American -like (but: Christlike).</p>
<p>201. “Vice,” “ex-,” “elect,” and “general,” constituting
parts of titles, should be connected with the chief
noun by a hyphen:</p>
<p>Vice-Consul Taylor, ex-President Cleveland, the governor-
elect, the postmaster-general. (But do not hyphenate mili-
tary terms such as: surgeon general, lieutenant general.)</p>
<p>202 . Compounds of “by-,” when this word forms the first
element of the compound, should be hyphenated:
by-product, by-laws (but: bygones).</p>
<p>203. The prefixes ” co-,” ” pre-,” and ” re-,” when followed
by the same vowel as that in which they terminate,
or by w or y, or by any letter that forms a diph-
thong with the last letter of the prefix, except in
very common words, take a hyphen; but, as a rule,
they do not when followed by a different vowel or
by a consonant, except to avoid mispronunciation :</p>
<p>co-operation, pre-empted, re-enter, co-worker, re-yield;
but: coequal, coeducation, prearranged, reinstal; cohabita-
tion, prehistoric, recast (but: re-use, re-read, co-author).
NOTE. The Botanical Gazette prints: cooperate, reenter, etc.</p>
<p>Exceptions are combinations with proper names, long
or unusual formations, and words in which the</p>
<p>78 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>omission of the hyphen would convey a meaning
different from that intended (cf . 9, 19, 208) :</p>
<p>pre-Raphaelite, re-democratize, re-pulverization; re-cover
( = cover again), re-creation, re-formation (as distinguished
from reformation).</p>
<p>204. Omit the hyphen from “today,” “tomorrow,”
“tonight,” “viewpoint,” “standpoint.” (See 119,
note.)</p>
<p>205. The negative particles “un-,” “in-,” “il-,” “im-,”
and “a-” do not usually require a hyphen:</p>
<p>unmanly, undemocratic, inanimate, indeterminate, illimitable,
impersonal, asymmetrical.</p>
<p>Exceptions would be rare and artificial combinations.
The particle “non-,” on the contrary, ordinarily calls
for a hyphen, except in the commonest words:</p>
<p>non-aesthetic, non-subservient, non-contagious, non-ability,
non-interference, non-evolutionary, non-membership, non-
unionist; but: nonage, nondescript, nonessential, nonplus,
nonsense, noncombatant.</p>
<p>206. ” Quasi-” prefixed to a noun or an adjective requires
a hyphen:</p>
<p>quasi-corporation, quasi-historical.</p>
<p>207. “Over” and “under” prefixed to a word should not
be followed by a hyphen, except in unusual cases:</p>
<p>overbold, overemphasize, overweight, underfed, underestimate,
undersecretary; but: over-soul, under-man, over-spiritualistic.</p>
<p>208. The Latin prepositions “ante,” “infra,” “inter,”
“intra,” “post,” “sub,” “super,” and “supra,”
and the Greek preposition “anti” prefixed to a</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 79</p>
<p>word do not ordinarily require a hyphen, unless fol-
lowed by the letter with which they terminate, or,
in the case of those prefixes ending in a vowel,
by -w, by -y, or by a vowel which would form a
diphthong in conjunction with the terminal letter:</p>
<p>antedate, antechamber, antediluvian, inframarginal, inter-
national, interstate, intercity, intramural, postscript, post-
graduate, postprandial, subconscious, submarine, subtitle,
subway, superfine, supraliminal, antidote, antiseptic (but:
anti-imperialistic cf. 203), intra-atomic, ante-war, intra-
yearly, ante-urban, anti-eclectic.</p>
<p>Exceptions are such formations as</p>
<p>ante-bellum, ante-Nicene, anti-Semitic, inter-university, post-
revolutionary.</p>
<p>209. “Extra,” “pan,” and “ultra” as a rule call for a
hyphen :</p>
<p>extra-hazardous, pan -Hellenic, ultra-conservative (but:
extraordinary, Ultramontane).</p>
<p>210. In fractional numbers, spelled out, connect by a
hyphen the numerator and the denominator, unless
either already contains a hyphen:</p>
<p>“The year is two-thirds gone”; four and five-sevenths;
thirty one-hundredths; but: thirty-one hundredths.</p>
<p>But do not hyphenate in such cases as</p>
<p>“One half of his fortune he bequeathed to his widow; the
other, to charitable institutions.”</p>
<p>211. In the case of two or more compound words occurring
together, which have one of their component elements</p>
<p>8o THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>in common, this element is frequently omitted from
all but the last word, and its implication should be
indicated by a hyphen :</p>
<p>in English- and Spanish-speaking countries; one-, five-, and
ten-cent pieces; “If the student thinks to find this character
where many a literary critic is searching in fifth- and tenth-
century Europe he must not look outside of manuscript tra-
dition.”</p>
<p>NOTE. Some writers regard this hyphen as an objectionable
Teutonism.</p>
<p>212. A hyphen is used to indicate a prefix or a suffix, as a
particle or syllable, not complete in itself:</p>
<p>“The prefix a-“; “The Spanish diminutive suffixes -ito
and -cita.</p>
<p>213. A hyphen is employed to indicate the syllables of a
word:</p>
<p>di-a-gram, pho-tog-ra-phy.</p>
<p>214. Following is a list of words of everyday occurrence
which should be hyphenated, and which do not fall
under any of the foregoing classifications :</p>
<p>after-years death-rate
anti-trust first-fruits
bas-relief folk-song
birth-rate horse-power
blood-feud ice-cream
blood-relations loan-word
coat-of-arms man-of-war

<p>grown-ups sledge hammer word formation</p>
<p>live stock standing room workingman</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 8 1</p>
<p>DIVISIONS</p>
<p>215. Avoid all unnecessary divisions of words. Wherever
consistent with good spacing, carry the whole word
over into the next line.</p>
<p>216. Do not, in wide measures (20 ems or more), divide
on a syllable of two letters, if possible to avoid it.
Never carry over a syllable of two letters. Good
spacing, however, is paramount. Words of four
letters like on-ly should never be divided; words
of five or six like oc-cur, of-fice, let-ter rarely.</p>
<p>217. Never let more than two consecutive lines termi-
nate in a hyphen, if at all avoidable. The next to
the last line in a paragraph ought not to end in a
divided word; and the last line (the “breakline”)
should, in measures of 15 ems and up, contain at
least four letters. Similarly, try to avoid a divided
word at the bottom of a right-hand (recto) page.</p>
<p>218. Do not divide proper nouns, especially names of
persons, unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>219. Do not separate (i.e., put in different lines) the
initials of a name, or such combinations as 1496 A.D.,
6:00 P.M., 6 43. 6d.</p>
<p>220. Avoid the separation of a divisional mark, e.g., (a)
or (i), in the middle of a sentence, from the section</p>
<p>82 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>which it precedes; i.e., do not allow such mark to
fall at the end of a line, but carry it over with the
matter to which it pertains.</p>
<p>221. Divide according to pronunciation (the American
system), not according to derivation (the English
system) :</p>
<p>democ-racy, not: demo-cracy; knowl-edge, not: know-ledge;
aurif-erous, not: auri-ferous; antip-odes (still better: antipo-
des see 224), not: anti-podes.</p>
<p>As far as is compatible with pronunciation and good
spacing, however, divide compounds on etymologi-
cal lines, or according to derivation and meaning:</p>
<p>dis-pleasure is better than displeas-ure; school-master,
than schoolmas-ter; never: passo-ver, une-ven, etc.</p>
<p>Never divide on a syllable with a silent vowel,</p>
<p>such as:</p>
<p>possi-ble, vex-ed, enti-tled, princi-ples.</p>
<p>222. When two consonants meet between vowels, and
the syllable ends on one consonant, the division
may properly be made between the consonants, the
pronunciation determining the place of division:</p>
<p>advan-tage, exces-sive, finan-cier, foun-da-tion, impor-tant,
In-dian, moun-tain, profes-sor, struc-ture.</p>
<p>223. Do not terminate a line in a soft c or g y or in a j.
Escape the division entirely, if possible; if not pos-
sible, divide:</p>
<p>pro-cess, not: proc-ess; ne-cessary, not: nec-essary; spa-
cing, not: spac-ing (the rule being that in present parti-</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 83</p>
<p>ciples the -ing should be carried over); pro-geny, not:
prog-eny; pre-judice, not: prej-udice.</p>
<p>NOTE. This rule differs from that followed by Webster and
other dictionaries.</p>
<p>224. Divide on a vowel wherever practicable. In case a
vowel alone forms a syllable in the middle of a word,
run it into the first line:</p>
<p>sepa-rate, not: sep-arate; particu-lar, not: partic-ular;
criti-cism, not: crit-icism.</p>
<p>Exceptions are words in -able and -ible, which should</p>
<p>carry the vowel over into the next line:</p>
<p>read-able, not: reada-ble; convert-ible, not: converti-ble.</p>
<p>225. In hyphenated nouns and adjectives avoid additional
hyphens:</p>
<p>object-lesson, not: object-les-son; fellow-being, not: fel-
low-being; poverty-stricken, not: pov-erty-stricken, much
less: pover-ty-stricken.</p>
<p>226. A coalition of two vowel-sounds into one (i.e., a
diphthong) should be treated as one letter. There-
fore do not divide:</p>
<p>peo-ple (either syllable makes a bad division), Cae-sar
(cf. 218), bu-ilding.</p>
<p>227. In derivatives from words ending in t, the t, in
divisions, should be carried into the next line with
the suffix if the accent has been shifted; if the deriva-
tive has retained the accent of the parent-word,
the / should be left in the first line :</p>
<p>objec-tive (from ob’ject); defect-ive (from defect’); but:
respec-tively, distinc-tive.</p>
<p>84 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>228. The addition of a plural s, adding a new syllable
to words ending in an s-sound, does not create a
new excuse for dividing such words:</p>
<p>hor-ses and circumstan-ces are impossible divisions.</p>
<p>229. Adjectives in -ical should be divided on the i:
physi-cal, not phys-ical nor physic-al.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="230">
<li>Do not divide nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p>231. The following are condensed rules for dividing
words in the foreign languages most frequently met
with in proofreading. While perhaps not entirely
comprehensive, they will be found to cover every
ordinary contingency.</p>
<p>FRENCH</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible, avoiding consonantal end-
ing of syllables:</p>
<p>in-di-vi-si-bi-li-te, a-che-ter; ta-bleau (not: tab-leau);
ba-lancer (not: bal-ancer).</p>
<p>6) Two consonants of which the second is / or r
(but not the combinations rl, Ir), are both carried
over to the following syllable:</p>
<p>ta-bleau, e”-cri-vain, per-dre, qua-tre; par-ler, hur-ler.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="3">
<li>There are as many syllables as there are vowels,</li>
</ol>
<p>even if soundless:</p>
<p>par-lent, vic-toi-re, pro-pri-e’-tai-re, guer-re, fil-les;</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 85</p>
<p>but a mute e following a vowel does not form a</p>
<p>syllable:</p>
<p>e-taient, joue-rai;</p>
<p>and i, y, o, ou, u, when preceding other vowels, are</p>
<p>often sounded as consonants, and then do not form</p>
<p>a syllable:</p>
<p>bien, 6-tions, yeux, loin, fouet-ter, 6-cuel-le.</p>
<p>GERMAN</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible:</p>
<p>hii-ten, le-ben, Fa-brik.</p>
<p>b) If several consonants stand between vowels,
usually only the last is carried over:</p>
<p>Rit-ter, klir-ren, Klemp-ner, Ver-wand-te, Karp-fen.</p>
<p>c) sz, ch, sch, ph, st, th are never separated (but see
(/) below):</p>
<p>Bu-sze, Be-cher, Ha-scher (but: Haus-chen), Geo-gra-phie,
La-sten, Ma-thilde.</p>
<p>d) If ck must be divided, it is separated into k-k:
Deckel Dek-kel.</p>
<p>e) In foreign words (Fremdivorter) , combinations of
b, d, g, k, p, t, with I or r are carried over:
Pu-bli-kum, Me-trum, Hy-drant.</p>
<p>/) Compound words are separated first into their
component elements, and within each element the
foregoing rules apply:
Fursten-schlosz, Tur-an-gel, Inter-esse.</p>
<p>86 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>ITALIAN</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible:</p>
<p>ta-vo-li-no, nar-ra-re.</p>
<p>b) s before a consonant, r following a consonant,
ch, gh, gli (gl), gn, qu, sc, d, fl, gl, pi are never
separated:</p>
<p>ca-sti-ghi, a-vro, mi-gli6-re, bi-so-gno, in-chi6-stro, u-scire.</p>
<p>c) i=y and u=w go with the following vowel;
ac, au, ei, eu, oi are not separated:</p>
<p>miei, tuoi.</p>
<p>SPANISH</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible:</p>
<p>ca-ra-co-les, re-ba-no, fle-xi-bi-li-dad.</p>
<p>b) br, bl, ch, cl, cr, dr, II, pr, rr, tr, and n, being
regarded as simple consonants, follow the fore-
going rule; cc and nn are divided, as in English:
mu-cha-cho, ba-ta-lla, bu-116, ba-rre-rio, ci-ga-rro; ac-ce-so,
en-no-ble-cer, in-ne-ga-ble.</p>
<p>c) The liquid consonants / and r, when preceded by
any consonant other than s, must not be separated
from that consonant, except in uniting parts of
compound words:</p>
<p>ha-blar, po-dria, ce-le-bra-ci-on, si-glo; but sub-lu-nar,
sub-ra-yar, es-la-bon.</p>
<p>d} Two separable consonants should be divided;
5 is always disjoined from a following consonant:
cuer-da, chas-co, pron-to; has-ta, as-pi-rar, cons-pi-rar.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 87</p>
<p>GREEK</p>
<p>a) Single consonants, combinations of consonants
which can begin a word, and mutes followed by p
or v are placed at the beginning of a syllable:</p>
<p>-^o), e-yw, e-OTre-pa, ve’-Krap, d-K/x,?7, Se-oytds, /ni-xpov, Trpa-
y/ia-Tos, yi-yvd&gt;-&lt;rKw.</p>
<p>Other combinations of consonants are divided:</p>
<p>irpacr-crw, eA-7rts, v-8ov, ap-/ta-Ta.</p>
<p>6) Compound words are divided into their original
parts; subject to that the foregoing rule applies:</p>
<p>7rpo&lt;r-a-y&lt;i&gt;, 7rap-a-yw.</p>
<p>LATIN</p>
<p>a) A Latin word has as many syllables as it has
vowels or diphthongs (ae, au, oe, ei, eu, ui).</p>
<p>b) When a single consonant occurs between two
vowels, divide before the consonant:</p>
<p>Cae-sar, me-ri-di-es.</p>
<p>c) In the case of two or more consonants divide
before the last consonant, except in the combina-
tions: mute (p, ph, b, t, th, d, c, ch, g)+liquid (/, r),
and qu or gu:</p>
<p>om-nis, scrip-tus, cunc-tus (but: pa-tris, e-quus, lin-gua).</p>
<p>d) Compound words are separated first into their
component elements, and within each element the
foregoing rules apply:</p>
<p>ad-est, ab-rum-po, red-e-o, trans-i-go.</p>
<p>88 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>FOOTNOTES</p>
<p>232. For reference indexes, as a rule, use superior figures.
Only in special cases should asterisks, daggers, etc.,
be employed (see 234); for instance, in tabular or
algebraic matter, where figures would be likely to
cause confusion. Index figures in the text should be
placed after the punctuation marks, without space,
except in German, where they are placed inside:</p>
<p>…. the niceties of style which were then invading Attic
prose, 1 and which made ….</p>
<p>1 In particular the avoidance of hiatus.
p^y+jt*</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Schenk’s equation.</li>
</ul>
<p>When figures are not used, the sequence of indexes
should be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(“asterisk” or “star”), f (“dagger”), % (“double dagger”),</li>
</ul>
<p>(“section mark”), || (“parallels”), ^ (“paragraph mark”).</p>
<p>233. Where references to the same work follow each
other closely and uninterruptedly, use ibid, instead
of repeating the title. Thus ibid, takes the place
of as much of the previous reference as is repeated:</p>
<p>Spencer, Principles of Sociology, chap, iv., p. 128.</p>
<p>Ibid., p. 129.</p>
<p>Barnes, “Charles Stunner,” Jour, of Pol. Econ., XXXV, 427.</p>
<p>Ibid., p. 435-</p>
<p>Ibid, should, however, not ordinarily be used for
the first footnote on a verso (left-hand) page; it is</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: FOOTNOTES 89</p>
<p>better usage either to repeat the title or, if the
reference is to the whole citation, to use loc. cit.
(the place cited) or op. cit. (the work cited) or
a.a.O. (am angezeigten Orte) in German:</p>
<p>‘Smith, Wealth of Nations, p. 289.</p>
<p>3 Loc. cit. (on verso page if exactly the same place is cited), or</p>
<p>3 Smith, op. cit., p. 290.</p>
<p>However op. cit. is not used to repeat the title of a
journal, but it may be used to refer to an author’s
work in a periodical and should not be used with-
out the author’s name clearly in text or footnote.</p>
<p>234. Footnotes to tables, whether the tables are ruled or
open, should be in 6 pt, and should invariably be
placed at the foot of the table and not at the foot of
the page. For reference indexes in such cases use
asterisks, etc., and not superior figures (see 232).</p>
<p>235. If the author’s name is given in the text in connec-
tion with a reference to, or a quotation from, his
work, it should not be repeated in the footnote:</p>
<p>…. This theory is questioned by Herbert, as follows-
“I cannot admit … .”’</p>
<p>1 Laws of the Ancients, 1, 153.</p>
<p>236. It is better to place the index figure in the text at
the end of the quotation (see illustration above).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="237">
<li>Ordinarily, omit “Vol.,” “chap.,” and “p.” in paren-</li>

sages. Use Roman numerals (capitals) for Volume,</p>
<p>90 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>Book, Part, Division, except in reference to ancient
classical works, when lower-case roman numerals
should be used; Roman numerals (lower-case) for
chapter and pages of introductory matter (Preface,
etc.) ; and Arabic numerals for number (Heft) and
text pages. Only when confusion would be liable
to arise, use ” Vol.,” “p.,” etc., in connection with the
numerals; but where the reference is to a page, un-
accompanied by further details, the abbreviation
“p.” or “pp.” must of course be used. In text
matter, not parenthetical, spell out chapter, verse,
page, line, note, figure, etc. In classical references
use no comma between author’s name and the title
of his work, and no comma following the title, unless
“Vol.,” “p.,” or some kindred symbol is used. In
all references to divisions of classical or ancient
works use periods in place of commas, reserving the
comma to indicate a succession (of pages, etc.) :</p>

<p>‘Fraser, The Golden Bough*, I, 27 [superior figure within
punctuation indicating number of the edition].</p>
<p>The same practice prescribed for classical references
is frequently desired by authors with respect to
English references, and may with equal propriety
be followed:</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: FOOTNOTES 91</p>
<p>1 W. W. Greg Pastoral Poetry and Pastoral Drama (London
1906) 114.</p>
<p>238. The date of publication in a reference to a periodical
should be put in parentheses immediately following
the volume number:</p>
<p>1 Barnes, “Lester Frank Ward,” Amer. Jour, of Social., XXV
(1919), 89.</p>
<p>If the citation is to month, year, and page only, the
date may appear in its natural order with commas:</p>
<p>3 “Problems of Reconstruction,” Journal of Political Economy,
May, 1919, p. 89.</p>
<p>239. In work set on the linotype machine, footnotes should
be renumbered consecutively through each article,
in a journal, or through each chapter, in a book,
to save resetting in case of change (see “Hints to
Authors and Editors,” note under “Footnotes,”
p. 122).</p>
<p>NOTE. Exceptions to these rules are footnotes in the Botani-
cal Gazette and the Astrophysical Journal, which have adopted
the following styles:</p>
<p>Botanical Gazette</p>
<p>1 LIVINGSTON, B. E., (i) On the nature of the stimulus which
causes the change in form of polymorphic green algae. BOT.
GAZ. 30:289-317. 1900.</p>
<p>3 , (2) The heredity of sex. Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool.</p>
<p>40:187-218. 1903.</p>
<p>Astrophysical Journal</p>
<p>1 ” Revision of Wolf’s Sun-Spot Relative Numbers,” Monthly
Weather Review, 30, 171, 1902.</p>
<p>3 Astrophysical Journal, 10, 333, 1899.</p>
<p>Botanical Gazette numbers its footnotes consecutively through-
out an article; all the other journals of the University of Chicago
Press number their footnotes from i up on each page, except
in special cases.</p>
<p>92 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>INDEXING</p>
<p>240. In indexes of proper names and other similar
alphabetical lists the following rules should be
observed :</p>
<p>a) Names beginning with M’, Me, Mac, or St.,
Ste., whether the following letter is capitalized or
not, should be listed as if the prefix were spelled
Mac, Saint, Sainte, thus making it unnecessary
for one who consults the index to look in several
places to make sure of rinding the name sought:</p>
<p>Machiavelli St. Louis</p>
<p>M’Intyre, Henry Sainte Beuve</p>
<p>Mclntyre, James Salt Lake City</p>
<p>Maclntyre, Thomas
Mack, Joseph</p>
<p>&amp;) Compound names should be listed under the
first part of the name. List the other parts of
the names in their respective alphabetical positions
and give a cross-reference to the first:</p>
<p>Campbell-Bannerman, Sir Henry</p>
<p>Stratton-Porter, Gene</p>
<p>Watts-Dunton, Theodore</p>
<p>Porter, Stratton, Gene. See Stratton-Porter</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the case of hyphenated
names gratuitously adopted, as in the case of
married women adding the maiden name to the
married name, the name preceding the hyphen
may be disregarded, and listing should be under</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: INDEXING 93</p>
<p>the letter of the true name, with a cross-reference
under the name preceding the hyphen.
c) Names with prefixes should be listed under the
part following the prefix, except (i) in English
(see b above); (ii) in French when the prefix
consists of or contains the article; (iii) in Italian
and Spanish when the prefix consists simply of the
article; (iv) in Dutch, the “Van,” “Ten,” etc., being
always capitalized (see 3, note); (v) when the
prefix and the name are written as one word.
Naturalized names with prefixes should be treated
according to the rules for the language adopted.</p>
<p>Hoffman, von; Lima, de; Ponte e Horto, da; Santos</p>
<p>Pereira Jardin, dos.</p>
<p>English: A Becket; De Quincey; De Morgan; D ‘Israeli;</p>
<p>MacDonald; Van Buren.</p>
<p>French: DuMoncel; La Rochefoucauld ; LeSage; DuPin;</p>
<p>Du Bocage; but: Rosny, de; Bouille, de; Allard, de.</p>
<p>Italian and Spanish: La Lumia; La Farina; Lo Gatto;</p>
<p>but: Farina, da; Rio, del; Torre, della.</p>
<p>Prefix compounded with the name: Vanderkinde, Zurlauben,</p>
<p>Dechambre, Vanderhoeck, Delacroix.</p>
<p>In the case of the exceptions above noted the
first letter of the prefix governs the alphabetical
position of the name.</p>
<p>d} Names spelled with the umlaut a, o, ii should
be listed as if the umlaut were spelled out ae,oe, ue:</p>
<p>Miiller, A.
Mufola, C.
Muller, B.</p>
<p>94 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>e) Names having two parts, or names of firms,
connected by “and,” “&amp;,” “y” (Spanish), “et”
(French), “und” (German), or “e” (Italian),
should be listed according to the first letter of the
name preceding the connective: Smith &amp; Evans
(under “S”); Gomez y Pineda (under “G”);
Loubet et Meunier (under “L”); Duncker und
Humblot (under “D”); Sandrone e Vallardi
(under “S”). ,</p>
<p>/) On the subject of cross-references see 62.
g) In indexing general terms the alphabetical ar-
rangement of subdivisions is much more useful
than the numerical order of page numbers; but in
so arranging such material only the first principal
word should be taken, i.e., adjective, noun, verb,
adverb, not the article, conjunction, or preposition:</p>
<p>Numbers: beginning a sentence, 73; in connected groups, how
treated, 73; consecutive treatment of, 113, 119; round, treat
ment of, 73; use of dash in consecutive, 119.</p>
<p>ti) Indexes are usually set in 6 or 8 pt. double
column, allowing i pica between columns. Entries
are separated by extra leads. Matter is usually
set flush and hang i em with solid runovers.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: TABULAR WORK 95</p>
<p>TABULAR WORK</p>
<p>241. In n-pt. and zo-pt. matter open (unruled) tables
should ordinarily be set in 9 pt. leaded; ruled, in
8 pt. solid. In 9-pt. matter both open and ruled
tables should be set in 8 pt. solid. In 8-pt. matter
open tables should be set in 6 pt. leaded; ruled, in
6 pt. solid. In 6-pt. matter both open and ruled
tables should be set in 6 pt. solid. For columns
representing totals, averages, percentages, and
generalizations italic and black-face figures may
be used if desired to set off the various classes of
results. (See Table III, p. 100.)</p>
<p>242. Captions for the columns of open tables and box-
heads for ruled tables should ordinarily be set in
6 pt. Box-heads of open tables should be 6-pt. caps
and lower case unless subheads are used, in which
case caps and small caps are used for the upper
head (see Table III, p. 100). In ruled tables with
box-heads of several stories the upper story pri-
mary heads should be set in caps and small caps,
except where the second story consists of figures
only (see Table I, p. 98) ; the lower secondary in
caps and lower case. Wherever small caps are
used in box-heads, the heading for the “stub” (i.e.,
first column) should, as a rule, also be set in caps
and small caps.</p>
<p>96 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>243. In ruled tables there should be at least two leads’
space between the horizontal rules and the matter
inclosed, and, if practicable, at least the equivalent
of an en quad, of the type in which the body of
the table is set, between the perpendicular rules and
the matter inclosed.</p>
<p>244. In open tables either periods, one em apart and
aligned, or leaders, may be used between the col-
umns (see 248). In ruled tables, in the “stub,”
leaders should usually be employed, if there is room,
except in case the stub runs over and a brace is
necessary. (A leader is a piece of type, having dots
[“period leader”] or short lines [“hyphen leader”]
upon its face, used in tables, indexes, etc., to
lead the eye across a space to the right word or
number.) An en leader is used instead of a
decimal point in tables.</p>
<p>245. In ruled columns of figures, to express a blank use
leaders across the full width of the column. Cen-
ter the figures in the column; if they cannot be put
in the exact center, and there is an unequal number
of digits in the groups, leave more space on the left
than on the right. All decimals and dollar signs
or other concrete values should be aligned.</p>
<p>246. When there is reading-matter in the columns of a
ruled table, it should be centered, if possible; if any
line runs over, use hanging indention, and align all
on the left.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: TABULAR WORK 97</p>
<p>247. Double rules should be used at the top of all tables,
but perpendicularly, as a usual thing, only when a
table is doubled up on itself and the stub is re-
peated. (See Table IV, p. 100.) In continued
broadside tables, where the heading is not repeated
use a single rule only. Repeat heading on each
even page.</p>
<p>248. Tables of two columns only should be set open;
of three or more, ruled, except in such a case as
the table on page 99. All continuations of tables
should be of the same dimensions, even if blank
columns are necessary, and tables with identical
headings should stand parallel.</p>
<p>249. “Table I,” etc., in headlines of tables should ordi-
narily be set in caps of the type in which the body of
the table is set and should not exceed the width of
the table; the following (descriptive) line, if any,
should be set in caps and small caps of the same
type. A single descriptive headline, not pre-
ceded by the number of the table, should be set
in caps of the type in which the table is set. A
footnote to the table should be set in 6 pt. with a
paragraph indention, and should not exceed the
width of the table. But when 6-pt. and 8-pt. ruled
tables are both used in the same work, use 8-pt.
headings over all tables (see 234). When tables
containing footnotes run over several pages, it is
necessary to repeat the footnotes on each even page.</p>

<p>TECHNICAL TERMS</p>
<p>EXPLANATION OF TECHNICAL TERMS</p>
<p>THE POINT SYSTEM</p>
<p>251. The point is the underlying unit of all typographical
measures.</p>
<p>252. The standard of measurement is the pica. A pica
is twelve points (one-sixth of an inch).</p>
<p>This line is set in 12 pt. (pica).
This line is set in n pt. (small pica).
This line is set in 10 pt. (long primer).
This line is set in 9 pt. (bourgeois).
This line is set in 8 pt. (brevier).
This line is set in 7 pt. (minion).
This line is set in 6 pt. (nonpareil).
This line is set in 5 pt. (pearl) .</p>
<p>The sizes larger or smaller than these are seldom
used in book composition.</p>
<p>STYLES OF TYPE</p>
<p>253. Ordinary type is called roman. To “roman-quote”
is to put in roman type between quotation marks.</p>
<p>This line is set in roman.</p>
<p>254. Type with a sloping face is called italic or italics.
Italic is indicated in manuscripts by a straight line
under the word or words (see p. 133)-</p>
<p>This line is set in italics.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>106 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>255. Type with a heavy black face is called bold face.
Bold face is indicated by a wavy line (see p. 133).
This line is set in bold face.</p>
<p>256. The body of a type is called the shank; the upper
surface, bearing the character, the face; the part
of the face projecting beyond the shank, the kern;
the part of the shank projecting beyond the face,
the shoulder.</p>
<p>257. A font, or complete assortment of a given size, of
type includes large capitals (“caps”), small capitals
(“small caps”), and lower-case letters (so called from
being placed in the lower half of the printer’s case).
Caps are indicated by three straight lines; small
caps, by two (see p. 133).</p>
<p>THESE ARE CAPS OF 9-PT. ROMAN.</p>
<p>THESE ARE SMALL CAPS OF Q-PT. ROMAN.</p>
<p>These are lower case of Q-pt. roman.</p>
<p>SPACING</p>
<p>258. The technical names for spaces and the methods of
spacing depend on whether the “foundry” type (i.e.,
type set by hand) or machine-set type is in question.
There are several makes of typesetting machines on
the market, but of these the monotype (see 293) and
the linotype (see 294) are in commonest use.</p>
<p>259. The monotype and linotype machines have come
into such universal use that a few words regarding
their respective systems of spacing are proper:</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: TECHNICAL TERMS 107
MONOTYPE</p>
<p>In monotype composition the unit system instead
of the pica system of measurement is used. There
are 18 units in a quad, which, unlike the em quad
of the foundry type for hand composition, is not a
perfect square at the end. The standard space
(see 261) is a 6-unit space =3-em space; a 5-unit
space =4-em space; a 4-unit space = a little less
than a 5-em space, and is the smallest space in use
on the monotype machine. These are cast from
matrices, and represent “fixed” spaces, i.e., un-
varying in width. On the other hand, in the pro-
cess of composition on the keyboard, the swelling,
or justifying, space is used to fill out a line. When
it is evident that another word or syllable cannot
be set in a line, the keys indicating the proper space
are struck by the operator, and all spaces in the
line are spread equally to fill out the line, resulting
in spaces which do not necessarily contain a specific
number of units (see 293).</p>
<p>LINOTYPE</p>
<p>260. On the linotype machine the pica system of meas-
urement is used. There are three “fixed” spaces
(see 261) : the em quad, the en quad, and the thin
space, which is equal to a 4-em space. To spread
the spaces, a space band is used; this band can
spread a space to any size between a 3-em space
and a space a trifle larger than an en quad. If a</p>
<p>108 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>space smaller than a thin space is required, it must
be put in by hand (see 294).</p>
<p>FOUNDRY TYPE (AND GENERAL)</p>
<p>261. An em, em quad, or simply quad (= quadrat) is a
block of type the top of which forms a perfect
square. A i2-pt. quad is thus a piece of metal
one-sixth of an inch square at the ends. The term
em is also used of the size of such a square in any
given size of type as a unit of measurement.
“Indent 8 pt. 2 ems” thus means that the line should
be indented 16 points. An em quad is used between
complete sentences (see 262). An em dash is a
dash the width of an em.</p>
<p>Two- and three-em quads are multiples of the above,
cast in one block of type metal. Two- and three-em
dashes are dashes the width of 2- and 3-em quads
respectively.</p>
<p>An en quad is half the size of an em quad in width.
Thus an 8-pt. en quad is 4 points wide (thick) and
8 points long (deep). An en dash is a dash the
width of an en quad.</p>
<p>A three-em space is one-third of an em hi thickness.
This is also called a thick space, and is the standard
space used to separate words.
A four-em space is one-fourth of an em; a five-em
space is one-fifth of an em. Four- and 5 -em spaces
are also called middle and thin spaces.
A hair-space is any space thinner than a 5-em.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: TECHNICAL TERMS 109</p>
<p>This line is spaced with em quads.</p>
<p>This line is spaced with en quads.</p>
<p>This line is spaced with 3 -em spaces.</p>
<p>This line is spaced with 4-em spaces.</p>
<p>This line is spaced with 5-em spaces.</p>
<p>The letters in this word are hair-spaced: America.</p>
<p>This is a 3 -em dash:</p>
<p>This is a 2 -em dash: -
This is an em dash:
This is an en dash: -</p>
<p>An em dash is often used in indexes and bibliog-
raphies before the first word (without space) of
subentries to save repeating.
A 2-em dash is used to follow a date indicating</p>
<p>time still continuing, as: 1876 .</p>
<p>A 2-em dash is used without space after a word
of which the ending is to be supplied.
A 3-em dash is used (with space on each side) to
denote a whole word omitted or to be supplied.
A 3-em dash is also used in bibliographies to indi-
cate the same author as above.</p>
<p>262. Space evenly. A standard line should have a 3-em
space between all words not separated by other
punctuation points than commas, and after commas;
an en quad after semicolons, and colons followed by
a lower-case letter; two 3-em spaces after colons
followed by a capital; an em quad after periods,
and exclamation and interrogation points, conclud-
ing a sentence.</p>
<p>no THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>263. If necessary to reduce spacing in a line, begin with
commas, and letters of slanting form i.e., with a
large “shoulder” on the side adjoining the space; if
necessary to increase, begin with overlapping let-
ters i.e., with “kerns” protruding on the side
adjoining the space straight-up-and-down letters,
and points other than periods and commas (in this
order).</p>
<p>264. In a well-spaced line, with a 3-em space between
a majority of the words, there should not be more
than an en quad between the rest; this proportion
should be maintained in increasing or reducing. To
justify a line is to adjust it, making it even or true,
by proper spacing.</p>
<p>265. Do not follow an exceptionally thin-spaced line with
an exceptionally wide-spaced one, or vice versa, if
at all avoidable.</p>
<p>266. Never hair-space, or em-quad, a line to avoid a
run-over.</p>
<p>267. Do not space out the last line of a paragraph that
allows of an indention of an em or more at the end.</p>
<p>268. Short words, like “a,” “an,” etc., should have the
same space on each side.</p>
<p>269. Use a thin space after , f, and similar signs; before
“f.,” “ff.,” and the metric symbols:</p>
<p>” 14. Be it further ordained … .”; pp. ioff.; i6cm.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: TECHNICAL TERMS III</p>
<p>270. In American and English sums of money no space
is used between the symbols, $ and (pounds),
5. (shillings) and d. (pence), and the numerals:
$2.75; 10 35. 2d.; 10 C.</p>
<p>271. After Arabic and Roman numerals at the beginning
of lines, denoting subsections, there should be an
en quad. After Arabic and Roman numerals at
the beginning of center-heads there should be an
em quad. Small-cap headings should have an en
quad between the words; cap-and-small-cap and
cap headings, two 3-em spaces.</p>
<p>272. Scripture references should be spaced thus (use
9-unit colon):</p>
<p>II Cor. 1:16-20; 2:5 3:12.</p>
<p>273. a) Between letters forming products, and before
superior figures or letters indicating powers, and
inferior figures or letters, ordinarily no space should
be used:</p>
<p>n x * = 2m 2 (v 2 z 2 zvwyz –2W*y*).</p>
<p>b) In capitalized headings use aligning figures.
INDENTATION (PRINTER’S TERM: INDENTION)</p>
<p>274. In linotype composition in measures of less than
10 picas’ width, indent all sizes i em. In measures
of from 10 to 20, indent u pt., i em; 10 pt., i|;
9 pt., i^; 8 pt., i^; 6 pt., 2. In measures of from
20 to 30, indent n pt., i^ ems; 10 pt., i^; 9 pt, if;
8 pt., 2; 6 pt., 2^. This is for plain paragraphs.</p>
<p>H2 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>In monotype composition indentions should be
such that all paragraph indentions align irrespec-
tive of the size of the type. The following inden-
tions are a good standard for measures of 19 to
30 picas: n pt. indented i^ ems or i em 9 units;
10 pt. indented if ems or i em 12 units; 9 pt.
indented if ems or i em 15 units; 8 pt. indented
2 ems; 6 pt. indented 2 ems or 2 ems 9 units.
Narrower measures should be indented proportion-
ately less; wider, proportionately more.
In hanging indentions, in measures of less than 10
picas, indent all sizes i em; from 10 to 20, n pt.,
10 pt., 9 pt., and 8 pt., i ems; 6 pt., 2 ems; from
20 to 30, ii pt., io-pt., 9 pt., and 8 pt, 2 ems;
6 pt., 3 ems.</p>
<p>275. In poetry center the longest line and let the inden-
tion be governed by that; unless the longest line
is of disproportionate length, in which case an
average of the long lines should be struck, the idea
being to give the whole a centered appearance.
Where quotations from different poems, following
each other in close succession, vary but slightly in
length of verse lines, it is better to indent all alike.
Indent according to rhymes and length of lines. In
blank verse, where the lines are approximately of
the same length, they should be aligned. If con-
secutive lines rhyme, they should likewise, as a rule,
be aligned. If the rhymes alternate, or follow at</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: TECHNICAL TERMS 113</p>
<p>certain intervals, indent the rhyming lines alike; that
is, if, e.g., lines i and 3, and 2 and 4, rhyme, set the
former flush in the measure previously determined by
the longest line, and indent the latter (usually one
em) ; follow this scheme in any similar arrangement.
If any line is disproportionately short that is, con-
tains a smaller number of feet indent it more:</p>
<p>And blessed are the homy hands of toil !
The busy world shoves angrily aside
The man who stands with arms akimbo set,
Until occasion tells him what to do.</p>
<p>I laugh at the lore and the pride of man,
At the sophist schools and the learned clan;
For what are they all, in their high conceit,
When man in the bush with God may meet ?</p>
<p>So nigh is grandeur to our dust,</p>
<p>So near is God to man,
When Duty whispers low, “Thou must,”</p>
<p>The youth replies, “I can.”</p>
<p>Not lightly fall</p>
<p>Beyond recall
The written scrolls a breath can float;</p>
<p>The crowning fact,</p>
<p>The kingliest act
Of Freedom is the freeman’s vote!</p>
<p>276. In ordinary reading-matter “plain paragraphs”
are always preferable. Where it is desired to bring
into relief the opening word or words of a paragraph,
or the number introducing such paragraph, or where
a center-head makes more than three lines, ” hanging
indention” is often employed (see 284).</p>
<p>H4 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>LEADS</p>
<p>277. A lead is a strip of metal used to separate lines of
type. The ordinary (standard) lead is 2 points
thick. Matter with leads between the lines is
called leaded; without, solid.</p>
<p>This book, for the most part, is set leaded. This paragraph,
for illustration, and the Index are set solid. Nearly all books
are leaded.</p>
<p>278. A slug is a strip of metal, thicker than a lead, used
in the make-up of printed matter into pages, to be
inserted after headlines, etc. The two standard
sizes are 6 and 12 points (a nonpareil and a pica)
thick, respectively.</p>
<p>HEADS OR HEADINGS</p>
<p>279. A center-head is a headline placed at equal distances
from both margins of the page or column. Center-
heads are usually set in caps or in small caps, and
are not followed by a period. This is a center-
head:</p>
<p>SEC. VH. THE PRINCIPLES OF SOCIOLOGY</p>
<p>When such center-head makes more than one line,
either the (inverted) “pyramid” form (for two or
three lines) or “hanging indention” (for more than
three lines) is employed :</p>

FORM AND DIMENSIONS OF THE SUN, AND SOME
SUGGESTIONS TOWARD EXPLAINING CERTAIN PHE-
NOMENA OF VARIABLE STARS</p>
<p>280. A side-head is a headline placed at the side of the
page or column. It may either be set in a separate
line, in which case it is usually set flush that is, in
alignment with the margin of the type-page; or
run in that is, run together in a continuous line
with the paragraph to which it belongs. The latter
is the more common form. Side-heads are most
frequently set in italics, only the first word and
proper names being capitalized; sometimes in caps
and small caps or in bold face (see 172) :</p>
<p>Side-head</p>
<p>A side-head is a headline ….
Side-head. A side-head is ….
SIDE -HEAD. A side-head is ….</p>
<p>Side-head</p>
<p>A side-head is ….</p>
<p>281. A cut-in head is a head placed in a box cut into
the side of the type-page, usually set in different
type, and as a rule placed under the first two lines
of the paragraph:</p>
<p>In making inquiry, therefore, into the value of fraternity</p>
<p>life among the children, it is necessary to test it entirely in</p>
<p>accordance with its power to contribute to the</p>

<p>school, being a social organization, has a right</p>
<p>to demand that every individual contribute the best that is</p>
<p>in him to the good of all. In making this contribution, it</p>

<li>A box-head is a head for a column in a ruled table</li>
</ol>
<p>(see 250).</p>
<p>283. A running-head is a headline placed at the top of
each page of a book, etc., usually giving the main
title of the work on the left-hand (verso) page, and
the title of the chapter, or other subdivision, on
the right-hand (recto} page. It should be cen-
tered on the page regardless of page number. A
good working rule for running-heads is to set them
in roman or italic capitals two sizes (points)
smaller than the type of the text.</p>
<p>PARAGRAPHS</p>
<p>284. Two kinds of paragraphs are distinguished plain
and hanging. A plain (or regular) paragraph has
the first line indented, and the others set flush. A
hanging paragraph (“hanging indention”) has the
first line set flush, and the others indented :</p>

<p>PROOFS</p>
<p>285. A galley-proof is a printed impression of the type
contained in a long, shallow receptacle of metal,
known as a galley, into which the compositor, the
operator, or the casting-machine places the material
as it is set, line by line.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: TECHNICAL TERMS 117</p>
<p>286. A page-proof is an impression of the type material
made up into page-form.</p>
<p>287. A plate-proof or foundry -proof is a proof taken of the
type-page immediately before an electrotype cast is
made of it. This proof has a black border around
the pages, made by ink from the metal frame used
to hold the type in place while the cast is being
made. Most publications nowadays are printed
from such plates, and not directly from the type.</p>
<p>288. A foul proof is a galley-proof containing author’s
corrections.</p>
<p>289. A revise is a new proof of type corrected from a
marked proof.</p>
<p>MAKE-UP</p>
<p>290. The arranging into page-form of type-lines and
illustrations is called the make-up.</p>
<p>291. A folio is a page-number. Even numbers are placed
on the verso; odd, on the recto. A drop-folio is a
page-number placed at the bottom of a page.</p>
<p>292. A half-title or bastard title is the abbreviated title of
a book placed on a separate page preceding the full
title-page, or the title of a part, chapter, etc., preced-
ing such part or chapter on a separate page in the
body of the book.</p>
<p>n8 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>TYPESETTING MACHINES</p>
<p>293. The monotype named Lanston after the patentee
is a composing-machine on which, by touching a key-
board, perforations are made in strips of paper, which
then are transferred to a second machine, where the
matrices to which the perforations correspond are
brought in contact with molten type metal, the
characters being cast separately and arranged auto-
matically on a galley in justified lines (see 259).</p>
<p>294. The linotype named Mergenthaler after its in-
ventor is a composing-machine on which, by
touching a keyboard, the matrices from which the
characters are cast arrange themselves automati-
cally in lines in a receptacle, which then is brought
in contact, on the same machine, with molten type
metal, through a mechanical device which liberates
and arranges in order on a galley the stereotyped
strips, called “slugs,” each consisting of a line of
type (see 260).</p>
<p>APPENDIX</p>
<p>HINTS TO AUTHORS AND EDITORS
PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS</p>
<p>Manuscripts should be either typewritten or in a
perfectly clear handwriting. The former is preferable.</p>
<p>The sheets should be of uniform size; 9”Xn” is a
desirable size.</p>
<p>Only one side of the paper should be used.</p>
<p>Never roll manuscripts; place them flat in a box or
an envelope.</p>
<p>The sheets should not be fastened together except by
pins or clips, which can easily be removed.</p>
<p>When one piece of a page is to be fastened to another,
use mucilage, not pins. Pins often become unfastened
and the slips lost or misplaced.</p>
<p>Liberal margins should be left at the top and left-
hand side of the sheets. This space will be needed by
the reader or printer for directions.</p>
<p>The pages should be numbered consecutively.
Inserted and omitted pages should be clearly indicated.
Thus, sheets to be inserted after p. 4 should be marked
“4A,” “46,” etc.; sheets omitted between p. 4 and p. 8
should be indicated by numbering p. 4, “4-7.”</p>
<p>Additions to original pages should be placed after the
sheets to which they belong, and should be marked
“Insert A,” “Insert B,” etc. The places where they are</p>
<p>122 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>to be inserted should be indicated by writing, “Here
insert A,” etc., on the margin of the original pages.</p>
<p>PARAGRAPHS</p>
<p>Paragraphs should be plainly indicated, either by
indenting the first line or by a ^f mark.</p>
<p>FOOTNOTES</p>
<p>Footnotes should be clearly designated, either by
separating them from the text by running a line across
the page, or by using ink of different color. Some writers
make a perpendicular fold in the paper, using two-
thirds of the space for the text and one-third for the
notes.</p>
<p>The word in the text carrying the note should be followed
by a superior figure corresponding to that preceding the
note.</p>
<p>Footnotes should never be run into the text in manu-
scripts, whether in parentheses or otherwise.</p>
<p>NOTE. It is important to remember that in matter set on the
linotype machine the slightest change necessitates the resetting of the
whole line. Since it is impossible to foresee how the notes will happen
to come out in the make-up, it is impracticable to number them from i
up on each page. The best way is to number them consecutively through-
out an article or by chapters in a book ; bearing in mind, however, the
very essential point that the change, by omission or addition, of one single
number involves the resetting of the whole first line of each succeeding note
to the end of the series, as well as the line in the text bearing the reference
to the note.</p>
<p>This difficulty is not met with in matter set on the monotype machine
or by hand, where the change of a number amounts simply to substituting
one figure for another.</p>
<p>HINTS TO AUTHORS AND EDITORS 123</p>
<p>PROPER NAMES, ETC.</p>
<p>Proper names, foreign words, and figures should, in
handwritten manuscript, be written with the utmost care
and distinctness.</p>
<p>TITLE-PAGES, ETC.</p>
<p>Copy for title-pages, prefaces, tables of contents, etc.,
should be submitted with the manuscript. Copy for
indexes should be compiled from the special set of page-
proofs furnished for this purpose and promptly delivered
to the printers. Unnecessary delay is often caused by
postponing these details till the last minute.</p>
<p>READING OF PROOFS</p>
<p>Read and return your proofs promptly.</p>
<p>In marking proof-sheets use the standard proofreaders’
marks (see p. 133). Do not adopt a system of your own,
which, however plain it may seem to you, might appear
less so to the compositor.</p>
<p>Be careful to answer all queries in the proofs. Delays
and errors often result from not attending to them.</p>
<p>Remember that changes in the type cost money. The
omission or addition of a word in the middle of a para-
graph may necessitate resetting the whole of this from
that point on; and if such alteration is made in the page-
proof, it may further involve repaging the entire article
or chapter. Make your manuscript as perfect as possible
before delivering it to the printer. Any necessary altera-
tions should be made in the galley-proof, as each succeeding</p>
<p>124 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>stage will add to the cost. Corrections in plates should
be studiously avoided. Not only are they expensive, but
they are likely to injure the plates.</p>
<p>The original manuscript should in each instance be
returned with the galley-proof, in order that the proof-
reader may refer to it, should any question arise; and
each successive set of proofs returned should be accom-
panied by the previous marked set. This will assist in
calculating the cost of alterations properly chargeable
to you.</p>
<p>HINTS TO PROOFREADERS 125</p>
<p>HINTS TO PROOFREADERS</p>
<p>Read everything as if you yourself were the author.</p>
<p>Be particularly careful about proper names and figures
and verify all dates. If the copy is not perfectly clear,
or if you have reason to doubt its correctness, look it up,
or query it to the author.</p>
<p>In asking questions of authors or editors make your
point clear. A simple query is not enough to draw
attention to the particular point you have in mind.
Queries in the manuscript should be transferred to the
proof, or attention should be directed in the proof to the
queries made by the copy-reader in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Be discreet about your queries. Do not stultify your-
self and discredit the office by asking foolish questions
on the proof. The author will be thankful for any
sensible suggestion you may make, but will resent trivial
criticisms.</p>
<p>Make a study of the “personal equation” in the case
of those individuals (editors and others) with whom you
as a proofreader will constantly have to deal. One person
may expect of you as a matter of course what another
might regard as an unwarranted interference.</p>
<p>Never hesitate to correct anything that is palpably
wrong, however positively the copy may assert the con
trary. Remember that the blame for the error will
eventually be laid at your door, and justly so.</p>
<p>126 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>Do not follow copy blindly, unreasoningly. Follow
copy only when, and as far as, it is correct.</p>
<p>Do not ask authors or editors to decide questions of
style. The Manual of Style is primarily meant for you.
Learn its rules so that you may correct any violation of
them you may find, without querying to the author.</p>
<p>Do not fall into the fallacy that the author’s or editor’s
O.K. relieves you of all or any part of your responsibility.
Authors and editors depend on the proofreader to see to
it that the typographical requirements have been met,
and that the adopted style has been adhered to, and
affix their signatures only on that supposition.</p>
<p>Do not shield yourself behind your copyholder. The
copyholder is there to assist you, not to tell you how to
do things. If you think you have cause to doubt her
version of a matter, investigate for yourself.</p>
<p>Do not suggest to the copyholder the reading of a word
or phrase which she has difficulty in making out from the
manuscript. If she cannot decipher the manuscript,
remember that you are the arbiter, and not the compositor.</p>
<p>Do not read to the copyholder except in special cases
in order to rest her after long, close work, and then pro-
ceed slowly and very distinctly. The copyholder’s eye
and ear are not yet trained to follow copy with insertions
and special editing as fast as you can read printed matter.</p>
<p>Do not permit yourself to be stampeded. Cultivate
speed, but remember that accuracy is even more impor-
tant. If the necessary time is not given you, take it
within reasonable limits in order to do things right.</p>
<p>HINTS TO PROOFREADERS 127</p>
<p>The credit accruing to you from doing things absolutely
right is likely to outlast the displeasure at your lack of
dispatch.</p>
<p>In unavoidable cases of “rush,” where conditions and
orders are imperative, protect yourself by letting it be
understood that you have done your best in the time
allotted you, but that you must disclaim any further
responsibility.</p>
<p>After completing the reading, sign all galley-proofs
and page-proofs in the upper right-hand corner with
your own initial above that of the copyholder and re-
viser. In case copyholding and revising are done by two
different people the copyholder’s initial should follow the
reader’s in smaller size above a line and the reviser’s
initial appear below. This will save time in tracing
proofs and insure the giving of credit where it belongs.</p>
<p>The number of proofs wanted should be marked on
first readings before they are sent to the corrector. Look
for any additional instructions on the job ticket or the
composition ticket and on the copy or author’s proofs.</p>
<p>All proofs ready to be corrected are to be returned to
the desk. When galley-proofs are ready to go out to the
author, the copyholder should give the copy to the file
clerk in perfect order, with proofs neatly arranged in the
required number of sets, pinned together at the top.</p>
<p>When you are reading page-proofs, the pages are to be
revised by checking with author’s alterations first. Next
make copy for contents (unless the journal editor is in the
habit of furnishing it) and return to be set. so that cover</p>
<p>128 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>and contents may be ready to go out with the page-
proofs.</p>
<p>When you are reading galley-proof, the first thing to
be read is the guide-line with size of type, width of
measure, job number, and galley number.</p>
<p>Mark the author’s name and composition number at
the beginning of each article, so that the compositor will
be able to charge alterations correctly. Keep the last
journal or sample beside you when reading the pages and
verify style in every case if you are not perfectly sure
of it. As fast as an article or a chapter is read, return
it to the desk so that corrections may be made in time to
be ready to go out as soon after you have finished the
whole as possible.</p>
<p>Read the running-heads and folios of each article or
chapter as a separate operation after you have finished
reading pages. Sign make-up record, as on pages, in the
upper right-hand corner; enter date and hour of sending
out proof in the lower right-hand corner of page-slip.
Record number of pages and plates in each article or
chapter and total number of pages in the finished product,
including preliminaries. Be careful to see that the fin-
ished book or journal will contain even forms of 16, 12,
or 8 pages; if it does not, the question should be raised.
Number and indicate all half-titles, blank pages, inserts,
etc., and carry all necessary queries on every set of
proofs.</p>
<p>When pages are ready to go out, place them neatly
in sets, pinned together at the top, and return them to</p>
<p>HINTS TO PROOFREADERS 129</p>
<p>the file clerk with all galley-proofs, and additional copy,
if any, in order of make-up, and neatly pinned together.
See that material is complete from cover to cover, includ-
ing volume title and contents when such pages are due.
Return all second proofs to file clerk’s desk to file and
leave page-slip on the hook, completed and dated.</p>
<p>130 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>HINTS TO COPYHOLDERS</p>
<p>Cultivate a low, soft, clear reading voice. Only your
own proofreader has to hear you.</p>
<p>Remember that, from the proofreader’s point of view,
the small words are as essential as the big ones. Get
them all in and get them in right.</p>
<p>Enunciate your plural s’s distinctly. Try to perfect
your enunciation so that you can read an entire galley
without error.</p>
<p>Regulate and equalize your speed. Do not race at a
breakneck pace through typewritten copy, while you thread
your path fumblingly through the mazes of manuscript.</p>
<p>Do not keep guessing at a word. Look at it closely,
consider the context, and do not speak it until you have
made it out or at least made the very best guess of which
you are capable.</p>
<p>Give your reader a chance to make his corrections.
Slow up the moment he puts his pencil to the paper. This
will save your going over the same ground twice. Repeat
cheerfully if the proofreader has not understood.</p>
<p>Evolve your own system of signals. Do not, for
instance, waste time by saying “in italics” for every word
or letter so treated. Instead, raise your voice, or tap
the table with your pencil once for each word, or both.
Such a code need not be intelligible to others than your-
self and your reader.</p>
<p>HINTS TO COPYHOLDERS 131</p>
<p>Read to your proofreader every instruction, editorial
mark, and stet-mark carefully. Learn the job number
and read it for every galley.</p>
<p>Consult the job ticket for the number of proofs wanted
and the name and address of the person to whom they
are to be sent, before having proofs corrected, so that the
number wanted may be marked for the printer.</p>
<p>Be careful in transferring marks. A mark in the wrong
place means two errors uncorrected in place of one cor-
rected. Each set of proofs must carry every mark.</p>
<p>In sending out proofs see that everything is there.
Arrange the copy and proof-sheets neatly and consecu-
tively.</p>
<p>Copy all queries and make-up instructions on the
galley-proof and indicate the insertion of tables, figures,
charts, etc., where they are first mentioned.</p>
<p>The manuscript should accompany the galley-proof;
the foul proof (author’s marked galley-proof) should
accompany the page-proof. In case no galley-proof has
been sent the manuscript should accompany the page-
proof.</p>
<p>Indicate in the lower left-hand corner the contents of
all the envelopes you address.</p>
<p>Fasten your pins in the center at the top, not diago-
nally in the left-hand corner, thus covering up the direc-
tions, etc., often written there.</p>
<p>Return every evening to the file or the bookcase any
volume that may have been taken out for reference dur-
ing the day; return all proofs ready for filing at least</p>
<p>132 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>once a day, so that files may be always as complete as
possible.</p>
<p>Remember that you are the housekeeper of the proof-
room, and take pride in its neat and orderly appearance.
Perfect your system so that everything can be located
at a moment’s notice. The more of that kind of work
you do without being asked, and the better you do it,
the more you will be appreciated.</p>

<p>It was not the first time that this grand prospect had been held forth to the world.
When Alexander was yet a young man, returning from his conquests in the Far East,
men must have anticipated, as very near, an empire not unlike that of Rome; for the
conquest of the West would have been no difficult matter to Alexander, with all the
resources of Asia under his hand. The successes of Pyrrhus, with his small army , against
the adult Rome of the third century, fresh from her Samnite conquests, show what would
have been the successes of Alexander, with his giant genius and armaments, against the
younger and feebler republic. And if the realization of the conqueror’s dreams was
hindered by his early death, most of the early Diadochi had each for many hard-fought
years aspired to be his sole successor, hoping to complete his work and regenerate the
distracted world by the potent influence of Hellenistic culture.</p>

<p>A world-empire, including all the lands and nations about the Mediterranean
Sea, reaching to the frozen North and the torrid South as its natural limits, exchanging
the virgin ores of Spain for the long-sought spices of Araby the Blest, was therefore no very
wild imagination. But while those that had conceived it and striven for it consciously
had failed, who could have imagined that it should drop almost suddenly, unexpectedly,
by the force, not of genius, but of circumstances, into the hands of a people who attained
it, not by the direction of an Alexander, but by such national qualities as had gained
for Sparta precedence and respect, coupled with aggressive wars under the guise of secur-
ing ever-widening frontiers, such as those which mark the rapid strides of Philip’s Mace-
donia?</p>
<p>Any political thinker who witnessed this mighty outcome of half a century might
indeed feel uneasy at the result, if he were not, like most of the Stoics, an optimist or
a fatalist. There was, no doubt, the manifest gain of a great peace throughout the
world, of the real settlement of disputes by the arbitration of an umpire with power to
enforce his will; there was the consequent development of wide commerce with its
diffusion, not only of wealth, but of enlightenment. These material gains were indis-
putable, even though a dangerous monopoly was being established, not merely through
the enormous advantages inseparable from Roman influence, but by the jealous de-
struction of all those commercial centers which might have rivaled Rome by reason
of favored situation or old traditions of trade.</p>

as very near, an empire not unlike that of Rome; for the conquest of
the West would have been no difficult matter to Alexander, with all
the resources of Asia under his hand. The successes of Pyrrhus, with

the younger and feebler republic.</p>

<p>A world-empire, including all the lands and nations about the
Mediterranean Sea, reaching to the frozen North and the torrid
South as its natural limits, exchanging the virgin ores of Spain for
the long-sought spices of Araby the Blest, was therefore no very
wild imagination. But while those that had conceived it and striven
for it consciously had failed, who could have imagined that it should
drop almost suddenly, unexpectedly, by the force, not of genius, but
of circumstances, into the hands of a people who attained it, not by
the direction of an Alexander, but by such national qualities as had
gained for Sparta precedence and respect, coupled with aggressive
wars under the guise of securing ever-widening frontiers, such as
those which mark the rapid strides of Philip’s Macedonia?</p>

<p>Any political thinker who witnessed this mighty outcome of half a century
might indeed feel uneasy at the result, if he were not, like most of the Stoics t
an optimist or a fatalist. There was, no doubt, the manifest gain of a great
peace throughout the world, of the real settlement of disputes by the arbitra-
tion of an umpire with power to enforce his will ; there was the consequent
development of wide commerce, with its diffusion, not only of wealth, but of
enlightenment. These material gains were indisputable, even though a dan-
gerous monopoly was being established, not merely through the enormous
advantages inseparable from Roman influence, but by the jealous destruction
of all those commercial centers which might have rivaled Rome by reason of
favored situation or old traditions of trade.</p>
<p>But far more serious was the patent fact, that neither the Roman people
nor their rulers had received any education to fit them for an imperial policy,
