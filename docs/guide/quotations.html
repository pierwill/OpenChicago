</ol>
<p>GENERAL RULES</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Quotation marks should always include ellipses, and the phrase “etc.” when it otherwise would not be clear that it stands for an omitted part of the matter quoted, perfect clearness in each individual case being the best criterion:</p>
<p>“Art. II, sec. 2, of the Constitution provides that ‘each state shall appoint …. a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives … .’”; “He also</p>
<p>wrote a series of ‘Helps to Discovery, etc.’” “etc.” here indicating, not that he wrote other works which are unnamed, but that the title of the one named is not given in full; but, on the other hand: “Preaching from the text, ‘For God so</p>
<p>loved the world,’ etc ” “etc.” here being placed</p>
<p>outside of the quotation marks in order to show that it does not stand for other, unnamed, objects of God’s love.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Quoted prose matter (i.e., matter set with quotation marks; see above) which is broken up into para- graphs should have the quotation marks repeated at the beginning of each paragraph.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Where alignment is desired, the quotation marks should be “cleared” i.e., should project beyond the line of alignment:</p>
<p>“Keep away from dirtiness keep away from mess.  Don’t get into doin’ things rather-more-or-less ! “</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Double quotation marks are used for primary quota- tions; for a quotation within a quotation, single; going back to double for a third, to single for a fourth, and so on:</p>
<p>“Let me quote from Rossetti’s Life of Keats” he said.  “Mr. Rossetti writes as follows:</p>
<p>“‘To one of these phrases a few words of comment may be given. That axiom which concludes the “Ode on a Grecian Urn”</p>
<p>‘”“Beauty is truth, truth beauty that is all</p>
<p>Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know,” is perhaps the most important contribution to thought which the poetry of Keats contains: it pairs with and transcends</p>
<p>“‘“A thing of beauty is a joy forever.”’</p>
<p>“And now I shall conclude my first point,” he continued, “by remarking that … .”</p>
