  <p>DIVISIONS</p>
<p>215. Avoid all unnecessary divisions of words. Wherever
consistent with good spacing, carry the whole word
over into the next line.</p>
<p>216. Do not, in wide measures (20 ems or more), divide
on a syllable of two letters, if possible to avoid it.
Never carry over a syllable of two letters. Good
spacing, however, is paramount. Words of four
letters like on-ly should never be divided; words
of five or six like oc-cur, of-fice, let-ter rarely.</p>
<p>217. Never let more than two consecutive lines termi-
nate in a hyphen, if at all avoidable. The next to
the last line in a paragraph ought not to end in a
divided word; and the last line (the “breakline”)
should, in measures of 15 ems and up, contain at
least four letters. Similarly, try to avoid a divided
word at the bottom of a right-hand (recto) page.</p>
<p>218. Do not divide proper nouns, especially names of
persons, unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>219. Do not separate (i.e., put in different lines) the
initials of a name, or such combinations as 1496 A.D.,
6:00 P.M., 6 43. 6d.</p>
<p>220. Avoid the separation of a divisional mark, e.g., (a)
or (i), in the middle of a sentence, from the section</p>
<p>82 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>which it precedes; i.e., do not allow such mark to
fall at the end of a line, but carry it over with the
matter to which it pertains.</p>
<p>221. Divide according to pronunciation (the American
system), not according to derivation (the English
system) :</p>
<p>democ-racy, not: demo-cracy; knowl-edge, not: know-ledge;
aurif-erous, not: auri-ferous; antip-odes (still better: antipo-
des see 224), not: anti-podes.</p>
<p>As far as is compatible with pronunciation and good
spacing, however, divide compounds on etymologi-
cal lines, or according to derivation and meaning:</p>
<p>dis-pleasure is better than displeas-ure; school-master,
than schoolmas-ter; never: passo-ver, une-ven, etc.</p>
<p>Never divide on a syllable with a silent vowel,</p>
<p>such as:</p>
<p>possi-ble, vex-ed, enti-tled, princi-ples.</p>
<p>222. When two consonants meet between vowels, and
the syllable ends on one consonant, the division
may properly be made between the consonants, the
pronunciation determining the place of division:</p>
<p>advan-tage, exces-sive, finan-cier, foun-da-tion, impor-tant,
In-dian, moun-tain, profes-sor, struc-ture.</p>
<p>223. Do not terminate a line in a soft c or g y or in a j.
Escape the division entirely, if possible; if not pos-
sible, divide:</p>
<p>pro-cess, not: proc-ess; ne-cessary, not: nec-essary; spa-
cing, not: spac-ing (the rule being that in present parti-</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 83</p>
<p>ciples the -ing should be carried over); pro-geny, not:
prog-eny; pre-judice, not: prej-udice.</p>
<p>NOTE. This rule differs from that followed by Webster and
other dictionaries.</p>
<p>224. Divide on a vowel wherever practicable. In case a
vowel alone forms a syllable in the middle of a word,
run it into the first line:</p>
<p>sepa-rate, not: sep-arate; particu-lar, not: partic-ular;
criti-cism, not: crit-icism.</p>
<p>Exceptions are words in -able and -ible, which should</p>
<p>carry the vowel over into the next line:</p>
<p>read-able, not: reada-ble; convert-ible, not: converti-ble.</p>
<p>225. In hyphenated nouns and adjectives avoid additional
hyphens:</p>
<p>object-lesson, not: object-les-son; fellow-being, not: fel-
low-being; poverty-stricken, not: pov-erty-stricken, much
less: pover-ty-stricken.</p>
<p>226. A coalition of two vowel-sounds into one (i.e., a
diphthong) should be treated as one letter. There-
fore do not divide:</p>
<p>peo-ple (either syllable makes a bad division), Cae-sar
(cf. 218), bu-ilding.</p>
<p>227. In derivatives from words ending in t, the t, in
divisions, should be carried into the next line with
the suffix if the accent has been shifted; if the deriva-
tive has retained the accent of the parent-word,
the / should be left in the first line :</p>
<p>objec-tive (from ob’ject); defect-ive (from defect’); but:
respec-tively, distinc-tive.</p>
<p>84 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>228. The addition of a plural s, adding a new syllable
to words ending in an s-sound, does not create a
new excuse for dividing such words:</p>
<p>hor-ses and circumstan-ces are impossible divisions.</p>
<p>229. Adjectives in -ical should be divided on the i:
physi-cal, not phys-ical nor physic-al.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="230">
<li>Do not divide nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p>231. The following are condensed rules for dividing
words in the foreign languages most frequently met
with in proofreading. While perhaps not entirely
comprehensive, they will be found to cover every
ordinary contingency.</p>
<p>FRENCH</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible, avoiding consonantal end-
ing of syllables:</p>
<p>in-di-vi-si-bi-li-te, a-che-ter; ta-bleau (not: tab-leau);
ba-lancer (not: bal-ancer).</p>
<p>6) Two consonants of which the second is / or r
(but not the combinations rl, Ir), are both carried
over to the following syllable:</p>
<p>ta-bleau, e”-cri-vain, per-dre, qua-tre; par-ler, hur-ler.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="3">
<li>There are as many syllables as there are vowels,</li>
</ol>
<p>even if soundless:</p>
<p>par-lent, vic-toi-re, pro-pri-e’-tai-re, guer-re, fil-les;</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 85</p>
<p>but a mute e following a vowel does not form a</p>
<p>syllable:</p>
<p>e-taient, joue-rai;</p>
<p>and i, y, o, ou, u, when preceding other vowels, are</p>
<p>often sounded as consonants, and then do not form</p>
<p>a syllable:</p>
<p>bien, 6-tions, yeux, loin, fouet-ter, 6-cuel-le.</p>
<p>GERMAN</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible:</p>
<p>hii-ten, le-ben, Fa-brik.</p>
<p>b) If several consonants stand between vowels,
usually only the last is carried over:</p>
<p>Rit-ter, klir-ren, Klemp-ner, Ver-wand-te, Karp-fen.</p>
<p>c) sz, ch, sch, ph, st, th are never separated (but see
(/) below):</p>
<p>Bu-sze, Be-cher, Ha-scher (but: Haus-chen), Geo-gra-phie,
La-sten, Ma-thilde.</p>
<p>d) If ck must be divided, it is separated into k-k:
Deckel Dek-kel.</p>
<p>e) In foreign words (Fremdivorter) , combinations of
b, d, g, k, p, t, with I or r are carried over:
Pu-bli-kum, Me-trum, Hy-drant.</p>
<p>/) Compound words are separated first into their
component elements, and within each element the
foregoing rules apply:
Fursten-schlosz, Tur-an-gel, Inter-esse.</p>
<p>86 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>ITALIAN</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible:</p>
<p>ta-vo-li-no, nar-ra-re.</p>
<p>b) s before a consonant, r following a consonant,
ch, gh, gli (gl), gn, qu, sc, d, fl, gl, pi are never
separated:</p>
<p>ca-sti-ghi, a-vro, mi-gli6-re, bi-so-gno, in-chi6-stro, u-scire.</p>
<p>c) i=y and u=w go with the following vowel;
ac, au, ei, eu, oi are not separated:</p>
<p>miei, tuoi.</p>
<p>SPANISH</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible:</p>
<p>ca-ra-co-les, re-ba-no, fle-xi-bi-li-dad.</p>
<p>b) br, bl, ch, cl, cr, dr, II, pr, rr, tr, and n, being
regarded as simple consonants, follow the fore-
going rule; cc and nn are divided, as in English:
mu-cha-cho, ba-ta-lla, bu-116, ba-rre-rio, ci-ga-rro; ac-ce-so,
en-no-ble-cer, in-ne-ga-ble.</p>
<p>c) The liquid consonants / and r, when preceded by
any consonant other than s, must not be separated
from that consonant, except in uniting parts of
compound words:</p>
<p>ha-blar, po-dria, ce-le-bra-ci-on, si-glo; but sub-lu-nar,
sub-ra-yar, es-la-bon.</p>
<p>d} Two separable consonants should be divided;
5 is always disjoined from a following consonant:
cuer-da, chas-co, pron-to; has-ta, as-pi-rar, cons-pi-rar.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 87</p>
<p>GREEK</p>
<p>a) Single consonants, combinations of consonants
which can begin a word, and mutes followed by p
or v are placed at the beginning of a syllable:</p>
<p>-^o), e-yw, e-OTre-pa, ve’-Krap, d-K/x,?7, Se-oytds, /ni-xpov, Trpa-
y/ia-Tos, yi-yvd&gt;-&lt;rKw.</p>
<p>Other combinations of consonants are divided:</p>
<p>irpacr-crw, eA-7rts, v-8ov, ap-/ta-Ta.</p>
<p>6) Compound words are divided into their original
parts; subject to that the foregoing rule applies:</p>
<p>7rpo&lt;r-a-y&lt;i&gt;, 7rap-a-yw.</p>
<p>LATIN</p>
<p>a) A Latin word has as many syllables as it has
vowels or diphthongs (ae, au, oe, ei, eu, ui).</p>
<p>b) When a single consonant occurs between two
vowels, divide before the consonant:</p>
<p>Cae-sar, me-ri-di-es.</p>
<p>c) In the case of two or more consonants divide
before the last consonant, except in the combina-
tions: mute (p, ph, b, t, th, d, c, ch, g)+liquid (/, r),
and qu or gu:</p>
<p>om-nis, scrip-tus, cunc-tus (but: pa-tris, e-quus, lin-gua).</p>
<p>d) Compound words are separated first into their
component elements, and within each element the
foregoing rules apply:</p>
<p>ad-est, ab-rum-po, red-e-o, trans-i-go.</p>
