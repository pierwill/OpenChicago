<p>35. The first word after a colon only when introducing
a complete passage, or sentence which would have
independent meaning, as in summarizations and
quotations not closely connected with what precedes;
or where the colon has the weight of such expres-
sion as “as follows,” “namely,” “for instance,” or
a similar phrase, and is followed by a logically com-
plete sentence:</p>
<p>“In conclusion I wish to say: It will be seen from the above
that ….”; “As the old proverb has it: ‘Haste makes
waste’”; “My theory is: The moment the hot current strikes
the surface … .”</p>

immediately connected with what precedes (unless,
as the first word of a sentence, beginning a paragraph
in reduced type) ; or the first word after a colon, if
an implied “namely,” or a similar term, is followed
by a brief explanatory phrase, logically dependent
upon the preceding clause:</p>
<p>“The old adage is true that ‘haste makes waste’”; “Two
explanations present themselves: either he came too late for
the train, or he was detained at the station.”</p>
<p>36. As a rule, the first word in sections of an enumera-
tion, if any one link contains two or more distinct
clauses, separated by a semicolon, colon, or period,
unless all are dependent upon the same term pre-
ceding and leading up to them (see 138) :</p>
<p>His reasons for refusal were three: (i) He did not have the

bility of the plan. But: He objected that (i) he did not
have the time; (2) he did not have the means; or, at any
rate, had no funds available; (3) he doubted the feasibility
of the plan.</p>
<p>37. As a rule, nouns followed by a numeral particu-
larly a capitalized Roman numeral indicating
their order in a sequence; also sums of money in
German and French:</p>
<p>Room 16, Ps. 20, Grade IV, Act I, Vol. I, No. 2, Book II,
Div. Ill, Part IV, Plate III; M. 6; Fr. 5.</p>

<p>38. The first word of a cited speech (or thought) in
direct discourse, whether preceded by a colon or a
comma (on this see 131):</p>
<p>On leaving he remarked: “Never shall I forget this day”;
With the words, “Never shall I forget this day,” he departed;
I thought to myself: This day I shall never forget (without
quotation marks).</p>
<p>39. In resolutions, the first words following ” WHEREAS”
and “Resolved”:</p>
<p>WHEREAS, It has pleased God … . ; therefore be it
Resolved, That ….</p>

adjectives, adverbs, verbs, first and last words) in
English titles of publications (books, pamphlets, doc-
uments, periodicals, reports, proceedings, etc.), and
their divisions (parts, chapters, sections, poems,
articles, etc.) ; in subjects of lectures, papers, toasts,
etc.; in cap-and-small-cap and italic center-heads
(both of which, however, should be avoided), and
bold-face cut-in heads and side-heads; in cap-and-
small-cap box-heads in tables (see 279-83) :</p>

Its Past and Present; the Report of the Committee oj Nine;
“In the Proceedings of the National Education Association
for 1907 there appeared a paper entitled, ‘The Financial
Value of Education.’”</p>
<p>NOTE. The Botanical Gazette capitalizes only first words and
proper names; and the practice may properly be followed in
general bibliographies, such as are to be found under the title
“Literature Cited” in the Botanical Gazette (see 60). This style
is very generally followed by librarians and others in the com-
pilation of lists of books and publications.</p>
<p>42. In foreign titles, in addition to capitalizing the first
word, follow these general rules:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>In Latin, capitalize proper nouns, and adjectives</li>
</ol>
<p>derived therefrom:</p>
<p>De amicitia, Bettum Gallicum.</p>
<p>6) In French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and Nor-
wegian titles, capitalize proper nouns but not ad-
jectives derived therefrom :</p>
<p>20 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>Histoire de la litterature franfaise, Novelle e racconti popolari
iialiani, Antologia de poetas liricos castellanos, Svenska littera-
turens historic.</p>
<p>c} In German and Danish, capitalize all nouns but
not the adjectives, except German adjectives derived
from the names of persons:</p>
<p>Geschichte des deutschen Feudalwesens (but: die Homer ische
Frage), Videnskabens Fremskridt i detnittende Aarhundrede;
and in abbreviations, B.P.W. for Berliner philologische
W ochenschrift.</p>
<p>d) In Dutch, capitalize all nouns, and all adjectives
derived from proper nouns:
Geschiedenis der Nederlandsche Taal.</p>
<p>43. In mentioning titles of newspapers, magazines, and
similar publications, do not, as a rule, treat the
definite article as part of the title:</p>
<p>the Chicago Tribune, the School Review, the Annual Register
of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>44. Titles of ancient manuscripts (singular, MS; plural,
MSS) (see 60):</p>
<p>Codex Bernensis, Cod. Canonicianus.</p>
<p>45. In titles with the main words capitalized, all nouns
forming parts of hyphenated compounds:</p>
<p>“Twentieth-Century Progress,” “The Economy of High-
Speed Trains.”</p>
<p>But do not capitalize such components when other
than nouns:</p>
<p>Fifty-first Street, “Lives of Well-known Authors,” “World-
Dominion of English-speaking Peoples.”</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: CAPITALIZATION 21</p>
<p>And in side-heads do not capitalize any but the first
word and proper nouns (see 56 and 172).</p>
<p>46. In botanical, geological, zoological, and paleonto-
logical matter, the scientific (Latin) names of divi-
sions, orders, families, and genera, but not their
English derivatives:</p>
<p>Cotylosauria, but: cotylosaurs; Felidae, but: felids;
Carnivora, but: carnivores.</p>
<p>Also in botanical and zoological matter, the names
of species, if derived from names of persons, or
from generic names; but in geological and medical
matter the names of species are never capitalized:</p>
<p>Felis leo, Cocos nucifera, Rosa Carolina, Parkinsonia Torrey-
ana, Styrax californica, Lythrum hyssopifolia, Phyleuma
Halleri, Car ex Halleriana (but [geological] : Pterygomatopus
schmidti, Conodectus favosus). (See 71.)</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="47">

ducing paragraphs and followed by a number:</p>
<p>NOTE. It should be noticed that ….</p>

<p>In botanical, geological, and paleontological matter, the names of genera and species when used together, and of genera, only, when used alone: Acer saccharum, Basidiobolus, Alternaria, Erythrosuchits.

<p>wrote a series of ‘Helps to Discovery, etc.’” “etc.” here indicating, not that he wrote other works which are unnamed, but that the title of the one named is not given in full; but, on the other hand: “Preaching from the text, ‘For God so</p>
<p>loved the world,’ etc ” “etc.” here being placed</p>
<p>outside of the quotation marks in order to show that it does not stand for other, unnamed, objects of God’s love.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Quoted prose matter (i.e., matter set with quotation marks; see above) which is broken up into para- graphs should have the quotation marks repeated at the beginning of each paragraph.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Where alignment is desired, the quotation marks should be “cleared” i.e., should project beyond the line of alignment:</p>
<p>“Keep away from dirtiness keep away from mess.  Don’t get into doin’ things rather-more-or-less ! “</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Double quotation marks are used for primary quota- tions; for a quotation within a quotation, single; going back to double for a third, to single for a fourth, and so on:</p>
<p>“Let me quote from Rossetti’s Life of Keats” he said.  “Mr. Rossetti writes as follows:</p>

form is used in quoted matter or in original signa-
tures; and “von” as part of a person’s name (see

note citations) to chapters, pages, lines, figures,
etc. (See 69.)</p>
<p>94. Subject to the exceptions named at the end of this
section, in ordinary reading-matter, all numbers of

others; if the largest contains three or more digits,
use figures for all (see 96) :</p>
<p>“The force employed during the three months was 87, 93,
and 106, respectively.”</p>
<p>As a general rule, however, decimals, degrees,
dimensions, distances, enumerations, money, per-
centage, weights, and like matter should be
expressed in figures:</p>
<p>10, 45 miles, 3 cubic feet, 24 pages, 100 bushels, 9 per cent
(see 123), 45 pounds, $1,000, etc.</p>
<p>95. Round numbers (i.e., approximate figures in even
units, the unit being 100 in numbers of less than
1,000, and 1,000 in numbers of more) :</p>
<p>“The attendance was estimated at five hundred” (but: “at
550”); “a thesis of about three thousand words” (but: “of
about 2,700”); “The population of Chicago is approximately
three millions” (but: “2,900,000”). Cases like 1,500, if for
some special reason spelled out, should be written “fifteen
hundred,” not “one thousand five hundred.”</p>

children under eighteen, besides 63 of the crew, went down
with the ship”; “Figure 3 shows the comparative difference
in prices.”</p>
<p>When this is impracticable, or for any reason unde-
sirable, reconstruct the sentence; e.g.:
“The total number of those who went down with the ship
was 593 men,” etc.</p>
<p>97. Sums of money, when occurring in isolated cases in
ordinary reading-matter :</p>
<p>“The admission was two dollars.”
When several such numbers occur close together, and
in all matter of a statistical character, use figures:
“Admission: men, $2; women, $i; children, 25 cents.”</p>

like many another, is open to modification in particu-
lar instances, for expediency, nature of context,
authoritative usage, and author’s preference. Gen-

<p>GENERAL RULES</p>
<p>112. In extracts from modern authors whose spelling and
punctuation differ but slightly from ours, and where
such variations do not affect the meaning, use office
style. In citations from Old English works, and
in cases where it appears to be essential to the
writer’s plan or the requirements of the context to
give a faithful rendering, follow the original copy.
Titles should always be accurately quoted.</p>
<p>113. Form the possessive of proper names ending in s or
another sibilant, if monosyllabic, by adding an
apostrophe and s; if of more than one syllable, by
adding an apostrophe only, except names ending
in -ce (see 165) :</p>
<p>King James’s Version, Burns’s poems, Marx’s theories;
Moses’ law, Jesus’ birth, Demosthenes’ orations, Berlioz’
compositions; Horace’s odes.</p>
<p>But in the case of proper names ending in a silent
sibilant the possessive is formed by the addition</p>
<p>46 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>of the apostrophe and s, whether the word is</p>
<p>monosyllabic or not:</p>
<p>Charlevoix’s discoveries, Des Moines’s population.</p>
<p>114. Before sounded h, long u (or eu), and the words
“one,” “once,” use “a” as the form of the indefinite
article:</p>
<p>a hotel, a harmonic rendition, a historical work, a union,
a euphonious word, such a one.</p>
<p>115. The ligatures &amp; and ce are not used at the present
day, either in Latin and Greek words, or in words
adopted into English from these languages. In
English these words are written either with ae, oe,
separately, or with e alone. The ligature is re-
tained, however, in Old English and in French:</p>
<p>aetas; Oedipus Tyrannus; aesthetic; (but: ceuvre,
French); but: maneuver; Alfred (Alfred in English).</p>
<p>116. Differentiate “farther” and “further” by using the
former in the sense of “more remote,” “at a greater
distance” (with verbs of action); the latter in the
sense of “moreover,” “in addition”:</p>
<p>the farther end; he went still farther; further, he suggested; a
further reason.</p>
<p>117. In forms of address (vocative) use the “O” without
a comma following; for an exclamation use “Oh,”
followed by a comma or an exclamation point
(see 40) :</p>
<p>“O thou most mighty ruler!” “Oh, why did not Cerberus
drag me back to hell ?”</p>

immediately preceding them:</p>
<p>“With the cry of Banzai! the regiment stormed the hill”,
Luke 4:160; paragraph 2 (a); Botanical Gazette 20:144.</p>
<p>PERIOD</p>

<p>V) Do not use a period after contractions cases
where a mechanical necessity compels the omission
of a letter or letters in the middle of a word for which
there is no recognized abbreviated form; such omis-
sion is indicated by an apostrophe:
m’f ‘g pl’t ( = manufacturing plant) ; ‘t isn’t.
c) Treat the metric symbols as abbreviations, but
not the chemical symbols, nor the phrase “per

for titles of well-known publications of which the
initials only are given, nor after MS (= manuscript),
nor after Mme and Mile in French (see 92) :
IE (=Indo-European), OE (= Old English), MHG (=Middle
High German); AJSL (= American Journal of Semitic
Languages and Literatures), ZAW (=Zeitschrijt filr alttesta-
mentliche Wissenschaff), CIL (= Cor pus Inscriptionum Lati-
norum), PMLA (= Publications of the Modern Language
Association}.</p>
<p>#. Use no period after Roman numerals, even if having
the value of ordinals:</p>
<p>Vol. IV; Louis XVI was on the throne.</p>
<p>#. Omit the period after running-heads (for explanation
of this and the following terms see 279-83); after
centered headlines; after side-heads set in separate
lines; after cut-in heads; after box-heads in tables;
and after superscriptions and legends which do not
form a complete sentence (with subject and predi-
cate), or which do not make more than a single line
of type; after date lines at top of communications,
and after signatures (see 50) .</p>
<p>#. The period is always placed inside the quotation
marks; and inside the parentheses when the matter
inclosed is an independent sentence and forms no
part of the preceding sentence; otherwise outside:</p>
<p>Tennyson’s “In Memoriam.” Put the period inside the
quotation marks. (This is a rule without exception.) When
tie parentheses form part of the preceding sentence, put
the period outside (as, for instance, here).</p>
<p>52 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>EXCLAMATION POINT</p>
<p>#. The exclamation point is used to mark an outcry, or
an emphatic or ironical utterance:</p>
<p>“Long live the king!” “Heaven forbid!” “Good!” he
cried; “How funny this seems!” “This must not be!” The
subject of his lecture was “The Thisness of the That”! The
speaker went on: “Nobody should leave his home tomorrow
without a marked ballot in their (!) pocket.”</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The exclamation point is placed inside the quotation</li>
</ol>
<p>marks or parentheses when part of the quotation
or parenthetical matter; otherwise outside.
See illustrations in 127.</p>
<p>INTERROGATION POINT</p>
<p>#. The interrogation point is used to mark a query, or
to express a doubt:</p>
<p>“Who is this ?” The prisoner gave his name as Roger Crown-
inshield, the son of an English baronet ( ?). Can the Bible
be applied to children ? is a question involved.</p>
<p>In Spanish the question mark is expressed before
as well as after the question, but the mark that
precedes is inverted.</p>
<p>Indirect questions should not be followed by an
interrogation point:
She asked whether he was ill.</p>
<p>A technically interrogative sentence disguised as
a question out of courtesy but actually embody-
ing a request does not need the interrogation
point:
Will you kindly sign and return the inclosed card.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 53</p>
<p>#. The interrogation point should be placed inside the
quotation marks or parentheses only when it is a
part of the quotation or parenthetical matter:</p>
<p>“Take hold, my son, of the toughest knots in life and try
to untie them; try to be worthy of man’s highest estate;
have high, noble, manly honor. There is but one test of
everything, and that is, Is it right?” (Henry A. Wise).
The question: “Who is who, and what is what?” Were
you ever in “Tsintsinnati” ?</p>
<p>COLON</p>
<p>#. The colon is used to “mark a discontinuity of
grammatical construction greater than that indicated
by the semicolon and less than that indicated by the
period. It is commonly used (i) to emphasize a
close connection in thought between two clauses
each of which forms a complete sentence, and which
might with grammatical propriety be separated by
a period; (2) to separate a clause which is gram-
matically complete from a second which contains
an illustration or amplification of its meaning; (3)
to introduce a formal statement, an extract, a speech
in a dialogue, etc.” (Century Dictionary] (unless
this is preceded by a conjunction, like “that,”
immediately connecting it with what goes before).
Before the quotation of a clause in the middle of a
sentence use a comma:</p>
<p>(i) “This argument undeniably contains some force: Thus
it is well known that …” “The secretion of the gland</p>
<p>54 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>goes on uninterruptedly: this may account for the condition
of the organ.” “The fear of death is universal: even the
lowest animals instinctively shrink from annihilation.” (2)
“Most countries have a national flower: France the lily,
England the rose, etc.” “Lambert pine: the gigantic sugar
pine of California.” (3) “The rule may be stated thus:
… .” “We quote from the address: … .” “Charles:
‘Where are you going?’ George: ‘To the mill-pond.’”
But: “He stoutly maintained that ‘the letter is a monstrous
forgery’”; and: “Declaring, ‘The letter is a monstrous
forgery,’ he tried to wash his hands of the whole affair.”</p>
<p>132. The colon thus often takes the place of an implied
“namely,” “as follows,” “for instance,” or a similar
phrase. Where such word or phrase is used, it
should be followed by a colon if what follows consists
of one or more grammatically complete clauses
(see 36) ; otherwise by a comma (see 145) :</p>
<p>“This is true of only two nations the wealthiest, though not
the largest, in Europe: Great Britain and France”; but:
“This is true of only two nations the wealthiest, though
not the largest, in Europe viz., Great Britain and France.”
“He made several absurd statements. For example: ….”;
but: “There are several states in the Union for instance,
Kansas and Wyoming which … .”</p>
<p>133. Put a colon after the salutatory phrase at the begin-
ning of a letter and after the introductory remark
of a speaker addressing the chairman or the audi-
ence:</p>
<p>MY DEAR MR. BROWN: (See 50.)</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: (See 64.)</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 55</p>
<p>134. Put a centered (g-unit) colon between chapter and
verse in Scripture passages, between hours and
minutes in time indications, and between volume
and page reference when such style is used:
Matt. 2:5-13; 4:30 P.M.; Botanical Gazette 20:144.</p>
<p>135. Put a colon between the place of publication and the
publisher’s name in literary and bibliographical
references :</p>
<p>Clement of Alexandria (London: Macmillan), II, 97.</p>
<p>136. The colon should be placed outside the quotation
marks, unless a part of the quotation:</p>
<p>He writes under the head of “Notes and Comments”:
” Many a man can testify to the truth of the old adage :” etc.</p>
<p>SEMICOLON</p>
<p>137. A semicolon is used to mark the division of a
sentence somewhat more independent than that
marked by a comma, or to separate complete
statements the argument of which is dependent
upon their remaining in the same sentence:</p>
<p>“Are we giving our lives to perpetuate the things that the
past has created for its needs, forgetting to ask whether these
things still serve today’s needs; or are we thinking of living
men ?” “This is as important for science as it is for practice;
indeed, it may be said to be the only important consideration.”
“It is so in war; it is so in the economic life; it cannot be
otherwise in religion.” “In Persia the final decision rests with
the Shah, advised by his ministers; in most constitutional
countries, indirectly with the people as represented in parlia-
ment; in Switzerland alone, through the referendum, directly
with the electorate at large.’’ “This, let it be remembered,</p>
<p>56 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>was the ground taken by Mill; for to him ‘utilitarianism,’
in spite of all his critics may say, did not mean the pursuit of
bodily pleasure.” (“For” in such cases should commonly be
preceded by a semicolon.)</p>
<p>138. In enumerations use a semicolon between the differ-
ent links, if these consist of more than a few words
closely connected, and especially if individual clauses
contain any punctuation mark of less value than a
period, or an exclamation or interrogation point
(unless inclosed in parentheses), yet are intimately
joined one with the other, and all with the sentence
or clause leading up to them, for instance through
dependence upon a conjunction, like “that,” pre-
ceding them (see 36) :</p>
<p>“The membership of the international commission was made
up as follows: France, 4; Germany, 5; Great Britain, i
(owing to a misunderstanding, the announcement did not
reach the English societies in time to secure a full quota from
that country. Sir Henry Campbell, who had the matter in
charge, being absent at the time, great difficulty was experi-
enced in arousing sufficient interest to insure the sending of
even a solitary delegate); Italy, 3; the United States, 7.”
“The defendant, in justification of his act, pleaded that (i)
he was despondent over the loss of his wife; (2) he was out
of work; (3) he had had nothing to eat for two days; (4) he
was under the influence of liquor.” “Presidents Hadley, of
Yale; Eliot, of Harvard; Butler, of Columbia; and Angell,
of Michigan.”</p>
<p>139. In Scripture references a semicolon is used to
separate passages containing chapters:</p>
<p>Gen. 2:3-6, 9, 14; 3:17; chap. 5; 6:15.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 57</p>
<p>140. The semicolon should be placed outside the quota-
tion marks or parentheses, unless a part of the
quotation or parenthetical matter.</p>
<p>COMMA</p>
<p>141. The comma is “used to indicate the smallest inter-
ruptions in continuity of thought or grammatical
construction, the marking of which contributes to
clearness” (Century Dictionary)’.</p>
<p>“Here, as in many other cases, what is sometimes popularly
supposed to be orthodox is really a heresy, an exaggeration,
a distortion, a caricature of the true doctrine of the church.
The doctrine is, indeed, laid down by an authority here and
there; but, speaking generally, it has no place in the stand-
ards, creeds, or confessions of the great communions; e.g.,
the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, the canons of the early
ecumenical councils, the Westminster Confession, the Thirty-
nine Articles.” “Shakspere and other, lesser, poets.” “The
books which I have read I herewith return” (i.e., I return
those [only] which I have read); but: “The books, which I
have read, I herewith return” (i.e., having read them [all],
I now return them). “Gossiping, women are happy”; and:
“Gossiping women are happy.” “Of these four, two Ameri-
cans and one Englishman started”; and: “Of these, four
two Americans and two Englishmen started.” “The suffer-
ing, God will relieve.” “Behind, her ‘stage mother’ stood
fluttering with extra wraps.” “Some boys and girls pre-
maturely announce themselves, usually in uncomfortable,
sometimes in bad, ways.”</p>
<p>142. Use a comma to separate proper nouns belonging
to different individuals or places:</p>
<p>“To John, Smith was always kind”; “To America, Europe
awards the prize of mechanical skill.”</p>
<p>58 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>143. Put a comma before “and,” “or,” and “nor”
connecting the last two links in a sequence of three
or more; or all the links in a series of greater length,
or where each individual link consists of several
words; always put a comma before “etc.”:</p>
<p>Tom, Dick, and Harry; either copper, silver, or gold; “He
was equally familiar with Homer, and Shakspere, and
Moliere, and Cervantes, and Goethe, and Ibsen”; “Neither
France for her art, nor Germany for her army, nor England
for her democracy, etc.”</p>
<p>But do not use a comma where “and,” etc., serves
to connect all of the links in a brief and close-knit
phrase :</p>
<p>“a man good and noble and true”; “I do not remember who
wrote the stanza whether it was Shelley or Keats or Moore.”</p>
<p>144. Ordinarily, put a comma before and after clauses in-
troduced by such conjunctions as “and,” “but,” “or,”
“if,” “while,” “as” (meaning “since”), “whereas,”
“since,” “because,” “when,” “after,” “although,”
etc., especially if a change of subject takes place:</p>
<p>“When he arrived at the railway station, the train had gone,
and his friend, who had come to bid him goodbye, had
departed, but left no word. As the next train was not due
for two hours, he decided to take a ride about the town,
although it offered little of interest to the sightseer. While
he regretted his failure to meet his friend, he did not go
to his house.”</p>
<p>But do not use a comma before clauses introduced
by such conjunctions if the preceding clause is not</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 59</p>
<p>logically complete without them; nor before “if,”
“but,” and “though” in brief and close-welded
phrases:</p>
<p>“This is especially interesting because they represent the two
extremes and because they present differences in their rela-
tions”; “This is good because true”; “I shall agree to this
only if you accept my conditions”; “I would not if I could,
and could not if I would”; “honest though poor”; “a cheap
but valuable book.”</p>
<p>145. Such conjunctions, adverbs, connective particles, or
phrases as “now,” “then,” “however,” “indeed,”
“therefore,” “moreover,” “furthermore,” “never-
theless,” “though,” “in fact,” “in short,” “for
instance,” “that is,” “of course,” “on the contrary,”
“on the other hand,” “after all,” “to be sure,”
“for example,” etc., may be followed by a comma
when standing at the beginning of a sentence or
clause to introduce an inference or an explanation,
and may be placed between commas when wedged
into the middle of a sentence or clause to mark off a
distinct break in the continuity of thought or struc-
ture, indicating a summarizing of what precedes,
the point of a new departure, or a modifying, restrict-
ive, or antithetical addition, etc. :</p>
<p>“Indeed, this was exactly the point of the argument”;
“Moreover, he did not think it feasible”; “Now, the question
is this: … .” “Nevertheless, he consented to the scheme”;
“In fact, rather thi reverse is true”; “This, then, is my
position: … .”; “The statement, therefore, cannot be
verified”; “He thought, however, that he would like to</p>
<p>60 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>try”; “That, after all, seemed a trivial matter”; “The
gentleman, of course, was wrong”; “A comma may be used
between clauses of a compound sentence that are connected
by a simple con junction, though a comma is emphatically not
used between clauses connected by a conjunctive adverb.”</p>
<p>But do not use a comma with such words when the
connection is logically close and structurally smooth
enough not to call for any pause in reading; with
“therefore,” “nevertheless,” etc., when directly
following the verb; with “indeed” when directly
preceding or following an adjective or another
adverb which it qualifies; nor ordinarily with such
terms as “perhaps,” “also,” “likewise,” etc.:</p>
<p>“Therefore I say unto you … .”; “He was therefore
unable to be present”; “It is nevertheless true”; “He is
recovering very slowly indeed”; “He was perhaps thinking
of the future”; “He was a scholar and a sportsman too.”</p>
<p>146. A comma is preferably omitted before “rather” in
such an expression as</p>
<p>“The time-value is to be measured in this way rather than
by the time-equivalent of the strata.”</p>
<p>147. If among several adjectives preceding a noun the
last bears a more direct relation to the noun than the
others, it should not be preceded by a comma:</p>
<p>“the admirable political institutions of the country”; “a hand-
some, wealthy young man.”</p>
<p>148. Participial clauses, especially such as contain an
explanation of the main clause, should usually be
set off by a comma :</p>
<p>“Being asleep, he did not hear him”; “Exhausted by a day’s
hard work, he slept like a stone.”</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 6 1</p>
<p>149. Put a comma before “not” introducing an anti-
thetical clause or phrase:</p>
<p>“Men addict themselves to inferior pleasures, not because
they deliberately prefer them, but because they are the only
ones to which they have access.”</p>
<p>But do not use commas before such words when the
thought is incomplete without the following words.</p>
<p>150. For parenthetical, adverbial, or appositional clauses
or phrases use commas to indicate structurally
disconnected, but logically integral, interpolations;
dashes to indicate both structurally and logically
disconnected insertions ; never use the two together
(see 175):</p>
<p>“Since, from the naturalistic point of view, mental states are
the concomitants of physiological processes … .”; “The
French, generally speaking, are a nation of artists”; “The
English, highly democratic as they are, nevertheless deem
the nobility fundamental to their political and social systems.”
“There was a time I forget the exact date when these
conditions were changed.”</p>
<p>151. Use a comma to separate two identical or closely
similar words, even if the sense or grammatical con-
struction does not require such separation (see 142) :</p>
<p>“Whatever is, is good”; “What he was, is not known”;
“The chief aim of academic striving ought not to be, to be
most in evidence “; “This is unique only in this, that … .”</p>
<p>152. In adjectival phrases a complementary, qualifying,
delimiting, or antithetical adjective added to the
main epithet preceding a noun should ordinarily be
preceded and followed by a comma:</p>
<p>62 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>“This harsh, though at the same time perfectly logical,
conclusion”; “The deceased was a stern and unapproach-
able, yet withal sympathetic and kind-hearted, gentleman ” ;
“Here comes in the most responsible, because it is the final,
office of the teacher”; “The most sensitive, if not the most
elusive, part of the training of children”; “The better a
proverb is, the more trite it usually becomes.”</p>
<p>153. Two or more co-ordinate clauses ending in a word
governing or modifying another word in a following
clause should be separated by commas :</p>
<p>“… . a shallow body of water connected with, but well
protected from, the open sea”; “He was as tall as, though
much younger than, his brother”; “The cultivation in our-
selves of a sensitive feeling on the subject of veracity is one of
the most useful, and the enfeeblement of that feeling one of
the most hurtful, things”; “This road leads away from,
rather than toward, your destination.”</p>
<p>154. Similarly, use a comma to separate two numbers:
“In 1905, 347 teachers attended the convention”; November
i, 1905. (See 160.)</p>
<p>155. A comma is employed to indicate the omission, for
brevity or convenience, of a word or words the
repetition of which is not essential to the meaning :
“In Illinois there are seventeen such institutions; in Ohio,
twenty-two; in Indiana, thirteen” ; “In Lincoln’s first cabinet
Seward was secretary of state; Chase, of the treasury;
Cameron, of war; and Bates, attorney general.”</p>
<p>Often, however, such constructions are smooth enough
not to call for commas (and consequent semicolons) :
“One puppy may resemble the father, another the mother,
and a third some distant ancestor.”</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 63</p>
<p>156. A direct quotation, maxim, or similar expression,
when brief, should be separated from the preceding
part of the sentence by a comma (see 131) :</p>
<p>” God said, Let there be light.”</p>
<p>157. Use a comma before “of” in connection with resi-
dence or position:</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Mclntyre, of Detroit, Mich.; President Hadley,
of Yale University.</p>
<p>Exceptions are those cases, historical and political, in
which the place-name practically has become a part
of the person’s name, or is so closely connected with
this as to render the separation artificial or illogical:</p>
<p>Clement of Alexandria, Philip of Anjou, King Edward of
England.</p>
<p>158. In literary references insert a comma between con-
secutive numbers to represent a break in the con-
tinuity, a separate reference to each; an en dash, to
represent one continuous reference between the
consecutive numbers:</p>
<p>pp. 4, 7-8, 10; Ezra 5:7-8; IV, 123-30.</p>
<p>159. Put a comma after digits indicating thousands, 1
except in a date or in a page-reference and not
between the constituents of dimensions, weights,
and measures:</p>
<p>1,276, 10,419; 2200 B.C.; p. 2461; 3 feet 6 inches; 4 Ib.
2 oz. ; 2 hr. 4 min.</p>
<p>NOTE. Astrophysical Journal and Botanical Gazette do not
use a comma with four figures.</p>
<p>1 Except in German and in Spanish, where a period is used instead, as: 69.190.175 .</p>
<p>64 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>160. Separate month and year and similar time divisions
by a comma:</p>
<p>November, 1905 ; New Year’s Day, 1906.</p>
<p>NOTE. Astrophysical Journal and Botanical Gazette do not
use a comma between month and year.</p>
<p>161. Omit the comma, in signatures and at the beginning
of articles, after author’s name followed by address,
title, or position in a separate line, or after address
followed by a date line, etc. (see 65).</p>
<p>162. The comma is always placed inside the quotation
marks, but following the parenthesis, if the con-
text requires it at all.</p>
<p>APOSTROPHE</p>
<p>163. An apostrophe is used to mark the omission of a
letter or letters in the contraction of a word, or of
figures in a number. In the case of contractions
containing a verb and the negative, do not use space
between the two components of the contraction:</p>
<p>it’s, ne’er, ‘twas, “takin’ me ‘at”; m’f’g; the class of ‘96;
don’t, haven’t. (See 123.)</p>
<p>164. The possessive case of nouns, common and proper,
is formed by the addition of an apostrophe, or
apostrophe and 5 (see 113) :</p>
<p>a man’s word, horses’ tails; Scott’s Ivanhoe, Jones’s farms,
Themistodes’ era; for appearance’ sake.</p>
<p>165. The plural of numerals, and of rare or artificial noun-
coinages, is formed by the aid of an apostrophe and
s; of proper nouns of more than one syllable ending
in a sibilant, by adding an apostrophe alone (mono-</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 65</p>
<p>syllabic proper names ending in a sibilant add es;
others, s) (see 101) :</p>
<p>in the i goo’s; in two’s and three’s, the three R’s, the
Y.M.C.A.’s; “these I-just-do-as-I-please’s”; “all the Tommy
Atkins’ of England” (but: the Rosses and the Macdougals);
the Pericles’ and Socrates’ of literature.</p>
<p>QUOTATION MARKS. (See section on “Quotations,”
74-91.)</p>
<p>DASHES</p>
<p>166. An em dash is used to denote “a sudden break,
stop, or transition in a sentence, or an abrupt change
in its construction, a long or significant pause, or
an unexpected or epigrammatic turn of sentiment”
(John Wilson) :</p>
<p>“Do we can we send out educated boys and girls from the
high school at eighteen ?” “The Platonic world of the static,
and the Hegelian world of process how great the contrast!”
” ‘Process’ that is the magic word of the modern period”;
“To be or not to be that is the question”; “Christianity
found in the Roman Empire a civic life which was implicated
by a thousand roots with pagan faith and cultus a state
which offered little.”</p>
<p>167. Use dashes (rarely parentheses see 177) for par-
enthetical clauses which are both logically and
structurally independent interpolations (see 150):</p>
<p>“This may be said to be but, never mind, we will pass over
that”; “There came a time let us say, for convenience, with
Herodotus and Thucydides when this attention to actions
was conscious and deliberate”; “If it be asked and in say-
ing this I but epitomize my whole contention why the
Mohammedan religion … .”</p>
<p>66 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>1 68. A clause added to lend emphasis to, or to explain or
expand, a word or phrase occurring in the main
clause, which word or phrase is then repeated,
should be introduced by a dash:</p>
<p>“To him they are more important as the sources for history
the history of events and ideas”; “Here we are face to face
with a new and difficult problem new and difficult, that is,
in the sense that … . “</p>
<p>169. Wherever a “namely” is implied before a paren-
thetical or complementary clause, a dash should
preferably be used (see 132) :</p>
<p>“These discoveries gunpowder, printing-press, compass,
and telescope were the weapons before which the old science
trembled”; “But here we are trenching upon another division
of our field the interpretation of New Testament books.”</p>
<p>170. In sentences broken up into clauses, the final
summarizing clause should be preceded by a dash :</p>
<p>“Amos, with the idea that Jehovah is an upright judge
… . ; Hosea, whose Master hated injustice and falsehood
… . ; Isaiah, whose Lord would have mercy only on those
who relieved the widow and the fatherless these were the
spokesmen … ‘</p>
<p>171. a) A word or phrase set in a separate line and suc-
ceeded by paragraphs, at the beginning of each of
which it is implied, should be followed by a dash :</p>
<p>“I recommend</p>
<p>” i. That we kill him.</p>
<p>“2. That we flay him.”</p>
<p>6) In French and in Spanish a dash is used before
a speech in direct discourse instead of quotation
marks before and after.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 67</p>
<p>172. A dash may be used in connection with side-heads,
whether “run in” or paragraphed:</p>
<p>2. The language of the New Testament. The lexicons
of Grimm-Thayer, Cremer, and others ….</p>
<p>NOTE. The above has been taken from ….</p>
<p>Biblical criticism in other denominations</p>
<p>A most interesting article appeared in the Expository
Times ….</p>
<p>173. Use a dash in place of the word “to” connecting
two words or numbers (see 158) :</p>
<p>May- July, 1906 (en dash); May i, 1905 November i, 1906
(em dash); pp. 3-7 (en dash); Luke 3:6 5:2 (em dash).</p>
<p>But if the word “from” precedes the first word or
number, do not use the dash instead of “to”:</p>
<p>From May i to July i, 1906.</p>
<p>In connecting consecutive numbers omit hundreds
from the second number i.e., use only two figures
unless the first number ends in two ciphers, in
which case repeat; if the next to the last figure in
the first number is a cipher, do not repeat this in the
second number; but in citing dates B.C. always
repeat the hundreds (because representing a dimi-
nution, not an increase) (see 158) :</p>
<p>1880-95, PP- 1I 3~ 1 ^’, 1900-1906, pp. 102-7; 387-324 B.C.</p>
<p>NOTE. The Astrophysical Journal and Botanical Gazette re-
peat the hundreds’ 1880-1895, pp. 113-116.</p>
<p>68 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>174. Let a dash precede the reference (author, title of
work, or both) following a direct quotation, consisting
of at least one complete sentence, in footnotes or
cited independently in the text (see 85) :</p>
<p>1 “I felt an emotion of the moral sublime at beholding
such an instance of civic heroism.” Thirty Years, I, 379.
The green grass is growing,</p>
<p>The morning wind is in it,
‘Tis a tune worth the knowing
Though it change every minute.</p>
<p>Emerson, “To Ellen, at the South.”</p>
<p>175. A dash should not ordinarily be used in connection
with any other point, except a period :</p>
<p>“DEAR SIR: I have the honor … .”; not: “DEAR SIR:
I have … .”; “This I say it with regret was not done”;
not: “This, I say it with regret, was … .”</p>
<p>But in a sentence where a comma would be neces-
sary if the parenthetical clause set off by dashes
did not exist, the comma may be retained before
the first dash:</p>
<p>Darwin, the promulgator of the theory, though by no
means its only supporter is regarded today, etc.</p>
<p>And when the parenthetical clause set off by dashes
itself requires an interrogation or exclamation
point, such punctuation may be retained in con-
nection with the second dash:</p>
<p>Senator Blank shall we call him statesman or politician ?
introduced the bill; If the ship should sink which God
forbid! he will be a ruined man.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 69</p>
<p>PARENTHESES</p>
<p>176. Place between parentheses figures or letters used to
mark divisions in enumerations run into the text:</p>
<p>“The reasons for his resignation were three: (i) advanced
age, (2) failing health, (3) a desire to travel.”</p>
<p>If such divisions are paragraphed, a single paren-
thesis is ordinarily used in connection with a lower-
case (italic) letter; a period, with figures and capital
(roman) letters. In syllabi, and matter of a similar
character, the following scheme of notation and
indention should ordinarily be adhered to:</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Under the head of ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperroman simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<p>ii) Under ….
(ft) Under ….</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="2">
<li>Under ….</li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="2">
<li>Under the head of ….</li>
</ol>
<p>177. Parentheses should not ordinarily be used for paren-
thetical clauses (see 150 and 167) unless confusion
might arise from the use of less distinctive marks, or</p>
<p>70 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>unless the content of the clause is wholly irrelevant
to the main argument:</p>
<p>“He meant I take this to be the (somewhat obscure) sense
of his speech that … .”; “The period thus inaugurated
(of which I shall speak at greater length in the next chapter)
was characterized by ….”; “The contention has been
made (op. cit.) that … .”</p>
<p>BRACKETS</p>
<p>178. Brackets are used (i) to inclose an explanation or
note, (2) to indicate an interpolation in a quotation,
(3) to rectify a mistake, (4) to supply an omission,
and (5) for parentheses within parentheses:</p>
<p>(1) ‘ [This was written before the publication of Spencer’s
book. EDITOR.]</p>
<p>(2) “These [the free-silver Democrats] asserted that the
present artificial ratio can be maintained indefinitely.”</p>
<p>(3) “As the Italian [Englishman] Dante Gabriel Ros-
[s]etti has said, … .”</p>
<p>(4) JohnRuskin. By Henry Carpenter. [“English Men
of Letters,” III.] London: Black, 1900.</p>
<p>(5) Grote, the great historian of Greece (see his History,
I, 204 [second edition] ),….</p>
<p>179. Such phrases as “To be continued” at the end, and
“Continued from … .” at the beginning, of
articles, chapters, etc., should be placed between
brackets, centered, and set in italics (see 73) and in
type reduced in size in accordance with the rule
governing reductions (see 86) :</p>
<p>[Continued from p. 320]

<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 71</p>
<p>ELLIPSES</p>
<p>180. Ellipses are used to indicate the omission, from a
quotation, of one or more words not essential to
the idea which it is desired to convey, and also
to indicate illegible words, mutilations, and other
lacunae in a document, manuscript, or other mate-
rial which is quoted. For an ellipsis at the begin-
ning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence four
periods, separated by a space (en quad), should
ordinarily be used, except in very narrow measures
(in French three only, with no space between).
If the preceding line ends in a point, this should
not be included in the four. Where a “whole para-
graph, or paragraphs, or, in poetry, a complete
line, or lines, are omitted, insert a full line of
periods, separated by em- or 2-em quads, according
to the length of the line. But the periods should not
extend beyond the length of the longest type-line:</p>
<p>The point … . is that the same forces …. are still</p>
<p>the undercurrents of every human life We may</p>
<p>never unravel the methods of the physical forces; …..
but ….</p>
<p>I think it worth giving you these details, because it is
a vague thing, though a perfectly true thing, to say that it
was by his genius that Alexander conquered the eastern
world.</p>
<p>His army, you know, was a small one. To carry a</p>
<p>vast number of men ….</p>
<p>“Aux armes! … aux armes! … les Prussiens!”</p>
<p>“Je n’ecris que ce que j’ai vu, entendu, senti ou eprouve</p>
<p>moi-me’me … j’ai deja publie quelques petits ouvrages …”</p>
<p>72 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>181. An ellipsis should be treated as a part of the citation;
consequently should be inclosed in the quotation
marks (see 178 [3]).</p>
<p>HYPHENS</p>
<p>182. A hyphen is placed at the end of a line the remainder
of the last word of which is carried to the next line
(see section on “Divisions”) and between many
compound words. The modern tendency is in favor
of writing as one two words which, when united,
convey but one idea:</p>
<p>schoolroom, workshop, headquarters.</p>
<p>Thus far, however, this practice is only a tendency;
there are many compound words which are better
hyphenated than consolidated. The following
rules are designed to cover such cases, but it must
be remembered that they are not to be applied
in all cases, and that a certain degree of judgment
must be exercised in their use.</p>
<p>183. Hyphenate two or more words (except proper names
forming a unity in themselves) combined into one
adjective preceding a noun, or into one pronoun.</p>
<p>so-called Croesus, well-known author, first-class investment,
better-trained teachers, high-school course, half-dead horse,
much-mooted question, joint-stock company, English-speaking
peoples, nineteenth-century progress, white-rat serum, up-to-
date machinery, four-year-old boy, house-to-house canvass,
go-as-you-please fashion, deceased-wife’s-sister bill; the
feeble-minded (person) ; but : New Testament times, Old
English spelling, an a priori argument.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 73</p>
<p>Do not hyphenate combinations of adverb and
adjective where no ambiguity could result:
an ever increasing flood.</p>
<p>Where one of the components contains more than</p>
<p>one word, an en dash should be used in place of a</p>
<p>hyphen:</p>
<p>New York-Chicago freight traffic, Norwegian-German-</p>
<p>Jewish immigrant.</p>
<p>But do not connect by a hyphen adjectives or par-
ticiples with adverbs ending in “-ly”; nor such
combinations as the foregoing when following the
noun, or qualifying a predicate:
highly developed species; a man well known in the neighbor-
hood; the fly-leaf, so called; “Her gown and carriage were
strictly up to date.”</p>
<p>184. Hyphenate, as a rule, nouns formed by the combina-
tion of two nouns standing in objective relation to
each other that is, one of whose components is
derived from a transitive verb:</p>
<p>mind-reader, story-teller, fool-killer, office-holder, well-wisher,
property-owner; hero-worship, wood-turning, clay-modeling,
curriculum -making.</p>
<p>Exceptions are common and brief compounds, un-
wieldy formations, or compounds with a special
meaning:</p>
<p>lawgiver, taxpayer, proofreader, bookkeeper, stockholder,
freehand, schoolboy, schoolgirl (but: school man, to dis-
tinguish from the Schoolmen of the Middle Ages) ; encyclo-
pedia compiler; waterproof, concussionproof.</p>
<p>74 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>185. A present participle united (i) with a noun to forma
new noun with a meaning different from that which
would be conveyed by the two words taken separately,
(2) with a preposition used absolutely (i.e., not gov-
erning a following noun), to form a noun, may
properly take a hyphen :</p>
<p>boarding-house, dining-hall, sleeping-room, dwelling-place,
printing-office, walking-stick, starting-point, stepping-
stone, stumbling-block (but meeting place) ; lean-to.</p>
<p>186. As a general rule, compounds of “book,” “house,”
“mill,” “room,” “shop,” and “work” should be
printed as one compact word, without a hyphen,
when the prefixed noun contains only one syllable,
should be hyphenated when it contains two, and
should be printed as two separate words when it
contains three or more:</p>
<p>handbook, schoolbook, notebook, textbook; pocket-book,</p>
<p>story-book; reference book.</p>
<p>boathouse, clubhouse, schoolhouse, storehouse; engine-house,</p>
<p>power-house; business house.</p>
<p>commill, handmill, sawmill, windmill; water-mill, paper-mill;</p>
<p>chocolate mill.</p>
<p>bedroom, classroom, schoolroom, storeroom; lecture-room;</p>
<p>recitation room; but: drawing-room (sitting-room) ; drawing</p>
<p>room (for lessons) .</p>
<p>tinshop, workshop; bucket-shop, tailor-shop; policy shop;</p>
<p>handwork, woodwork; metal-work; filigree work.</p>
<p>Exceptions are rare combinations, and such as for
appearance’ sake would better be separated:
wheat mill, school work, home work, class work, book
work, team work, source book.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 75</p>
<p>187. Compounds of “maker,” “dealer,” and other words
denoting occupation should ordinarily be hyphen-
ated; likewise nouns combined in an adjectival
sense before a proper noun:</p>
<p>harness-maker, book-dealer, (see 184); a soldier-statesman,
the poet-artist Rossetti. (Exceptions are a few short
words of everyday occurrence: bookmaker, dressmaker,
shopgirl.)</p>
<p>188. Compounds of “store” should be hyphenated when
the prefix contains only one syllable; otherwise not:</p>
<p>drug-store, feed-store (but: bookstore); grocery store, dry-
goods store.</p>
<p>189. Compounds of “fellow” are hyphenated when
forming the first element of the compound:</p>
<p>fellow-man, fellow-beings; but: playfellow; “Mr. Good-
fellow”; politics makes strange bedfellows.</p>
<p>190. Compounds of “father,” “mother,” “brother,”
“sister,” “daughter,” “parent,” and “foster” should
be hyphenated when forming the first element of
the compound:</p>
<p>father-love (but: fatherland), mother- tongue, brother-officer,
sister-nation, foster-son, daughter-cells, parent-word.</p>
<p>191. Compounds of “great,” indicating the fourth degree
in a direct line of descent, call for a hyphen:
great-grandfather, great-grandson.</p>
<p>1 92. Compounds of ” life ” and ” world ” require a hyphen :</p>
<p>life-history, life-principle (but: lifetime), world-power, world-
problem.</p>
<p>76 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>193. Compounds of “skin” with words of one syllable
are to be printed as one word; with words of more
than one, as two separate words:</p>
<p>calfskin, sheepskin; alligator skin.</p>
<p>194. Compounds of “master” should be hyphenated:
master-builder, master-stroke (exception: masterpiece).</p>
<p>195. Compounds of “god,” when this word forms
the second element of the compound, should be
hyphenated:</p>
<p>sun-god, rain-god (but: godsend, godson).</p>
<p>196. “Half,” “quarter,” etc., combined with a noun
should be followed by a hyphen:</p>
<p>half-truth, half- tone; half-year, half-title, quarter-mile; but
not the adverb “halfway.”</p>
<p>197. “Semi-,” “demi-,” “bi-,” “tri-,” etc., do not ordina-
rily demand a hyphen, unless followed by i, w, or y:</p>
<p>semiannual, demigod, bipartisan, bichromate, bimetallist,
trimonthly, tricolor, trifoliate, semi-incandescent, bi-
weekly, tri-yearly.</p>
<p>Exceptions are long or unusual formations:
semi-barbarous, semi-translucent.</p>
<p>198. Compounds of “self,” when this word forms the
first element of the compound, are hyphenated:
self-evident, self-respect.</p>
<p>199. Combinations with “fold” are to be printed as one
word if the number contains only one syllable; if it
contains more, as two:</p>
<p>twofold, tenfold; fifteen fold, a hundred fold.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 77</p>
<p>200. Adjectives formed by the suffixation of “like” to
a noun are usually printed as one word if the noun
contains only one syllable (except when ending in
/); if it contains more (or is a proper noun), they
should be hyphenated:</p>
<p>childlike, homelike, warlike, godlike; eel-like, bell-like;
woman-like, business-like; American -like (but: Christlike).</p>
<p>201. “Vice,” “ex-,” “elect,” and “general,” constituting
parts of titles, should be connected with the chief
noun by a hyphen:</p>
<p>Vice-Consul Taylor, ex-President Cleveland, the governor-
elect, the postmaster-general. (But do not hyphenate mili-
tary terms such as: surgeon general, lieutenant general.)</p>
<p>202 . Compounds of “by-,” when this word forms the first
element of the compound, should be hyphenated:
by-product, by-laws (but: bygones).</p>
<p>203. The prefixes ” co-,” ” pre-,” and ” re-,” when followed
by the same vowel as that in which they terminate,
or by w or y, or by any letter that forms a diph-
thong with the last letter of the prefix, except in
very common words, take a hyphen; but, as a rule,
they do not when followed by a different vowel or
by a consonant, except to avoid mispronunciation :</p>
<p>co-operation, pre-empted, re-enter, co-worker, re-yield;
but: coequal, coeducation, prearranged, reinstal; cohabita-
tion, prehistoric, recast (but: re-use, re-read, co-author).
NOTE. The Botanical Gazette prints: cooperate, reenter, etc.</p>
<p>Exceptions are combinations with proper names, long
or unusual formations, and words in which the</p>
<p>78 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>omission of the hyphen would convey a meaning
different from that intended (cf . 9, 19, 208) :</p>
<p>pre-Raphaelite, re-democratize, re-pulverization; re-cover
( = cover again), re-creation, re-formation (as distinguished
from reformation).</p>
<p>204. Omit the hyphen from “today,” “tomorrow,”
“tonight,” “viewpoint,” “standpoint.” (See 119,
note.)</p>
<p>205. The negative particles “un-,” “in-,” “il-,” “im-,”
and “a-” do not usually require a hyphen:</p>
<p>unmanly, undemocratic, inanimate, indeterminate, illimitable,
impersonal, asymmetrical.</p>
<p>Exceptions would be rare and artificial combinations.
The particle “non-,” on the contrary, ordinarily calls
for a hyphen, except in the commonest words:</p>
<p>non-aesthetic, non-subservient, non-contagious, non-ability,
non-interference, non-evolutionary, non-membership, non-
unionist; but: nonage, nondescript, nonessential, nonplus,
nonsense, noncombatant.</p>
<p>206. ” Quasi-” prefixed to a noun or an adjective requires
a hyphen:</p>
<p>quasi-corporation, quasi-historical.</p>
<p>207. “Over” and “under” prefixed to a word should not
be followed by a hyphen, except in unusual cases:</p>
<p>overbold, overemphasize, overweight, underfed, underestimate,
undersecretary; but: over-soul, under-man, over-spiritualistic.</p>
<p>208. The Latin prepositions “ante,” “infra,” “inter,”
“intra,” “post,” “sub,” “super,” and “supra,”
and the Greek preposition “anti” prefixed to a</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: PUNCTUATION 79</p>
<p>word do not ordinarily require a hyphen, unless fol-
lowed by the letter with which they terminate, or,
in the case of those prefixes ending in a vowel,
by -w, by -y, or by a vowel which would form a
diphthong in conjunction with the terminal letter:</p>
<p>antedate, antechamber, antediluvian, inframarginal, inter-
national, interstate, intercity, intramural, postscript, post-
graduate, postprandial, subconscious, submarine, subtitle,
subway, superfine, supraliminal, antidote, antiseptic (but:
anti-imperialistic cf. 203), intra-atomic, ante-war, intra-
yearly, ante-urban, anti-eclectic.</p>
<p>Exceptions are such formations as</p>
<p>ante-bellum, ante-Nicene, anti-Semitic, inter-university, post-
revolutionary.</p>
<p>209. “Extra,” “pan,” and “ultra” as a rule call for a
hyphen :</p>
<p>extra-hazardous, pan -Hellenic, ultra-conservative (but:
extraordinary, Ultramontane).</p>
<p>210. In fractional numbers, spelled out, connect by a
hyphen the numerator and the denominator, unless
either already contains a hyphen:</p>
<p>“The year is two-thirds gone”; four and five-sevenths;
thirty one-hundredths; but: thirty-one hundredths.</p>
<p>But do not hyphenate in such cases as</p>
<p>“One half of his fortune he bequeathed to his widow; the
other, to charitable institutions.”</p>
<p>211. In the case of two or more compound words occurring
together, which have one of their component elements</p>
<p>8o THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>in common, this element is frequently omitted from
all but the last word, and its implication should be
indicated by a hyphen :</p>
<p>in English- and Spanish-speaking countries; one-, five-, and
ten-cent pieces; “If the student thinks to find this character
where many a literary critic is searching in fifth- and tenth-
century Europe he must not look outside of manuscript tra-
dition.”</p>
<p>NOTE. Some writers regard this hyphen as an objectionable
Teutonism.</p>
<p>212. A hyphen is used to indicate a prefix or a suffix, as a
particle or syllable, not complete in itself:</p>
<p>“The prefix a-“; “The Spanish diminutive suffixes -ito
and -cita.</p>
<p>213. A hyphen is employed to indicate the syllables of a
word:</p>
<p>di-a-gram, pho-tog-ra-phy.</p>
<p>214. Following is a list of words of everyday occurrence
which should be hyphenated, and which do not fall
under any of the foregoing classifications :</p>
<p>after-years death-rate
anti-trust first-fruits
bas-relief folk-song
birth-rate horse-power
blood-feud ice-cream
blood-relations loan-word
coat-of-arms man-of-war
cross-reference mid-year</p>
<p>object-lesson title-page
page-proof trade-mark
pay-roll wave-length
poor-law well-being
sea-level well-nigh
sense-perception well-wisher
subject-matter will-power
thought-process</p>
<p>Otherwise Webster’s Dictionary is standard for :</p>
<p>bedrock Nonconformist trade unions</p>
<p>farm land Pan-German un-Christian</p>
<p>grown-ups sledge hammer word formation</p>
<p>live stock standing room workingman</p>
<p>DIVISIONS</p>
<p>215. Avoid all unnecessary divisions of words. Wherever
consistent with good spacing, carry the whole word
over into the next line.</p>
<p>216. Do not, in wide measures (20 ems or more), divide
on a syllable of two letters, if possible to avoid it.
Never carry over a syllable of two letters. Good
spacing, however, is paramount. Words of four
letters like on-ly should never be divided; words
of five or six like oc-cur, of-fice, let-ter rarely.</p>
<p>217. Never let more than two consecutive lines termi-
nate in a hyphen, if at all avoidable. The next to
the last line in a paragraph ought not to end in a
divided word; and the last line (the “breakline”)
should, in measures of 15 ems and up, contain at
least four letters. Similarly, try to avoid a divided
word at the bottom of a right-hand (recto) page.</p>
<p>218. Do not divide proper nouns, especially names of
persons, unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>219. Do not separate (i.e., put in different lines) the
initials of a name, or such combinations as 1496 A.D.,
6:00 P.M., 6 43. 6d.</p>
<p>220. Avoid the separation of a divisional mark, e.g., (a)
or (i), in the middle of a sentence, from the section</p>
<p>82 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>which it precedes; i.e., do not allow such mark to
fall at the end of a line, but carry it over with the
matter to which it pertains.</p>
<p>221. Divide according to pronunciation (the American
system), not according to derivation (the English
system) :</p>
<p>democ-racy, not: demo-cracy; knowl-edge, not: know-ledge;
aurif-erous, not: auri-ferous; antip-odes (still better: antipo-
des see 224), not: anti-podes.</p>
<p>As far as is compatible with pronunciation and good
spacing, however, divide compounds on etymologi-
cal lines, or according to derivation and meaning:</p>
<p>dis-pleasure is better than displeas-ure; school-master,
than schoolmas-ter; never: passo-ver, une-ven, etc.</p>
<p>Never divide on a syllable with a silent vowel,</p>
<p>such as:</p>
<p>possi-ble, vex-ed, enti-tled, princi-ples.</p>
<p>222. When two consonants meet between vowels, and
the syllable ends on one consonant, the division
may properly be made between the consonants, the
pronunciation determining the place of division:</p>
<p>advan-tage, exces-sive, finan-cier, foun-da-tion, impor-tant,
In-dian, moun-tain, profes-sor, struc-ture.</p>
<p>223. Do not terminate a line in a soft c or g y or in a j.
Escape the division entirely, if possible; if not pos-
sible, divide:</p>
<p>pro-cess, not: proc-ess; ne-cessary, not: nec-essary; spa-
cing, not: spac-ing (the rule being that in present parti-</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 83</p>
<p>ciples the -ing should be carried over); pro-geny, not:
prog-eny; pre-judice, not: prej-udice.</p>
<p>NOTE. This rule differs from that followed by Webster and
other dictionaries.</p>
<p>224. Divide on a vowel wherever practicable. In case a
vowel alone forms a syllable in the middle of a word,
run it into the first line:</p>
<p>sepa-rate, not: sep-arate; particu-lar, not: partic-ular;
criti-cism, not: crit-icism.</p>
<p>Exceptions are words in -able and -ible, which should</p>
<p>carry the vowel over into the next line:</p>
<p>read-able, not: reada-ble; convert-ible, not: converti-ble.</p>
<p>225. In hyphenated nouns and adjectives avoid additional
hyphens:</p>
<p>object-lesson, not: object-les-son; fellow-being, not: fel-
low-being; poverty-stricken, not: pov-erty-stricken, much
less: pover-ty-stricken.</p>
<p>226. A coalition of two vowel-sounds into one (i.e., a
diphthong) should be treated as one letter. There-
fore do not divide:</p>
<p>peo-ple (either syllable makes a bad division), Cae-sar
(cf. 218), bu-ilding.</p>
<p>227. In derivatives from words ending in t, the t, in
divisions, should be carried into the next line with
the suffix if the accent has been shifted; if the deriva-
tive has retained the accent of the parent-word,
the / should be left in the first line :</p>
<p>objec-tive (from ob’ject); defect-ive (from defect’); but:
respec-tively, distinc-tive.</p>
<p>84 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>228. The addition of a plural s, adding a new syllable
to words ending in an s-sound, does not create a
new excuse for dividing such words:</p>
<p>hor-ses and circumstan-ces are impossible divisions.</p>
<p>229. Adjectives in -ical should be divided on the i:
physi-cal, not phys-ical nor physic-al.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="230">
<li>Do not divide nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p>231. The following are condensed rules for dividing
words in the foreign languages most frequently met
with in proofreading. While perhaps not entirely
comprehensive, they will be found to cover every
ordinary contingency.</p>
<p>FRENCH</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible, avoiding consonantal end-
ing of syllables:</p>
<p>in-di-vi-si-bi-li-te, a-che-ter; ta-bleau (not: tab-leau);
ba-lancer (not: bal-ancer).</p>
<p>6) Two consonants of which the second is / or r
(but not the combinations rl, Ir), are both carried
over to the following syllable:</p>
<p>ta-bleau, e”-cri-vain, per-dre, qua-tre; par-ler, hur-ler.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="3">
<li>There are as many syllables as there are vowels,</li>
</ol>
<p>even if soundless:</p>
<p>par-lent, vic-toi-re, pro-pri-e’-tai-re, guer-re, fil-les;</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 85</p>
<p>but a mute e following a vowel does not form a</p>
<p>syllable:</p>
<p>e-taient, joue-rai;</p>
<p>and i, y, o, ou, u, when preceding other vowels, are</p>
<p>often sounded as consonants, and then do not form</p>
<p>a syllable:</p>
<p>bien, 6-tions, yeux, loin, fouet-ter, 6-cuel-le.</p>
<p>GERMAN</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible:</p>
<p>hii-ten, le-ben, Fa-brik.</p>
<p>b) If several consonants stand between vowels,
usually only the last is carried over:</p>
<p>Rit-ter, klir-ren, Klemp-ner, Ver-wand-te, Karp-fen.</p>
<p>c) sz, ch, sch, ph, st, th are never separated (but see
(/) below):</p>
<p>Bu-sze, Be-cher, Ha-scher (but: Haus-chen), Geo-gra-phie,
La-sten, Ma-thilde.</p>
<p>d) If ck must be divided, it is separated into k-k:
Deckel Dek-kel.</p>
<p>e) In foreign words (Fremdivorter) , combinations of
b, d, g, k, p, t, with I or r are carried over:
Pu-bli-kum, Me-trum, Hy-drant.</p>
<p>/) Compound words are separated first into their
component elements, and within each element the
foregoing rules apply:
Fursten-schlosz, Tur-an-gel, Inter-esse.</p>
<p>86 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>ITALIAN</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible:</p>
<p>ta-vo-li-no, nar-ra-re.</p>
<p>b) s before a consonant, r following a consonant,
ch, gh, gli (gl), gn, qu, sc, d, fl, gl, pi are never
separated:</p>
<p>ca-sti-ghi, a-vro, mi-gli6-re, bi-so-gno, in-chi6-stro, u-scire.</p>
<p>c) i=y and u=w go with the following vowel;
ac, au, ei, eu, oi are not separated:</p>
<p>miei, tuoi.</p>
<p>SPANISH</p>
<p>a) The fundamental principle is to divide on a
vowel as far as possible:</p>
<p>ca-ra-co-les, re-ba-no, fle-xi-bi-li-dad.</p>
<p>b) br, bl, ch, cl, cr, dr, II, pr, rr, tr, and n, being
regarded as simple consonants, follow the fore-
going rule; cc and nn are divided, as in English:
mu-cha-cho, ba-ta-lla, bu-116, ba-rre-rio, ci-ga-rro; ac-ce-so,
en-no-ble-cer, in-ne-ga-ble.</p>
<p>c) The liquid consonants / and r, when preceded by
any consonant other than s, must not be separated
from that consonant, except in uniting parts of
compound words:</p>
<p>ha-blar, po-dria, ce-le-bra-ci-on, si-glo; but sub-lu-nar,
sub-ra-yar, es-la-bon.</p>
<p>d} Two separable consonants should be divided;
5 is always disjoined from a following consonant:
cuer-da, chas-co, pron-to; has-ta, as-pi-rar, cons-pi-rar.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: DIVISIONS 87</p>
<p>GREEK</p>
<p>a) Single consonants, combinations of consonants
which can begin a word, and mutes followed by p
or v are placed at the beginning of a syllable:</p>
<p>-^o), e-yw, e-OTre-pa, ve’-Krap, d-K/x,?7, Se-oytds, /ni-xpov, Trpa-
y/ia-Tos, yi-yvd&gt;-&lt;rKw.</p>
<p>Other combinations of consonants are divided:</p>
<p>irpacr-crw, eA-7rts, v-8ov, ap-/ta-Ta.</p>
<p>6) Compound words are divided into their original
parts; subject to that the foregoing rule applies:</p>
<p>7rpo&lt;r-a-y&lt;i&gt;, 7rap-a-yw.</p>
<p>LATIN</p>
<p>a) A Latin word has as many syllables as it has
vowels or diphthongs (ae, au, oe, ei, eu, ui).</p>
<p>b) When a single consonant occurs between two
vowels, divide before the consonant:</p>
<p>Cae-sar, me-ri-di-es.</p>
<p>c) In the case of two or more consonants divide
before the last consonant, except in the combina-
tions: mute (p, ph, b, t, th, d, c, ch, g)+liquid (/, r),
and qu or gu:</p>
<p>om-nis, scrip-tus, cunc-tus (but: pa-tris, e-quus, lin-gua).</p>
<p>d) Compound words are separated first into their
component elements, and within each element the
foregoing rules apply:</p>
<p>ad-est, ab-rum-po, red-e-o, trans-i-go.</p>
<p>TABULAR WORK</p>
<p>241. In n-pt. and zo-pt. matter open (unruled) tables
should ordinarily be set in 9 pt. leaded; ruled, in
8 pt. solid. In 9-pt. matter both open and ruled
tables should be set in 8 pt. solid. In 8-pt. matter
open tables should be set in 6 pt. leaded; ruled, in
6 pt. solid. In 6-pt. matter both open and ruled
tables should be set in 6 pt. solid. For columns
representing totals, averages, percentages, and
generalizations italic and black-face figures may
be used if desired to set off the various classes of
results. (See Table III, p. 100.)</p>
<p>242. Captions for the columns of open tables and box-
heads for ruled tables should ordinarily be set in
6 pt. Box-heads of open tables should be 6-pt. caps
and lower case unless subheads are used, in which
case caps and small caps are used for the upper
head (see Table III, p. 100). In ruled tables with
box-heads of several stories the upper story pri-
mary heads should be set in caps and small caps,
except where the second story consists of figures
only (see Table I, p. 98) ; the lower secondary in
caps and lower case. Wherever small caps are
used in box-heads, the heading for the “stub” (i.e.,
first column) should, as a rule, also be set in caps
and small caps.</p>
<p>96 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>
<p>243. In ruled tables there should be at least two leads’
space between the horizontal rules and the matter
inclosed, and, if practicable, at least the equivalent
of an en quad, of the type in which the body of
the table is set, between the perpendicular rules and
the matter inclosed.</p>
<p>244. In open tables either periods, one em apart and
aligned, or leaders, may be used between the col-
umns (see 248). In ruled tables, in the “stub,”
leaders should usually be employed, if there is room,
except in case the stub runs over and a brace is
necessary. (A leader is a piece of type, having dots
[“period leader”] or short lines [“hyphen leader”]
upon its face, used in tables, indexes, etc., to
lead the eye across a space to the right word or
number.) An en leader is used instead of a
decimal point in tables.</p>
<p>245. In ruled columns of figures, to express a blank use
leaders across the full width of the column. Cen-
ter the figures in the column; if they cannot be put
in the exact center, and there is an unequal number
of digits in the groups, leave more space on the left
than on the right. All decimals and dollar signs
or other concrete values should be aligned.</p>
<p>246. When there is reading-matter in the columns of a
ruled table, it should be centered, if possible; if any
line runs over, use hanging indention, and align all
on the left.</p>
<p>MANUAL OF STYLE: TABULAR WORK 97</p>
<p>247. Double rules should be used at the top of all tables,
but perpendicularly, as a usual thing, only when a
table is doubled up on itself and the stub is re-
peated. (See Table IV, p. 100.) In continued
broadside tables, where the heading is not repeated
use a single rule only. Repeat heading on each
even page.</p>
<p>248. Tables of two columns only should be set open;
of three or more, ruled, except in such a case as
the table on page 99. All continuations of tables
should be of the same dimensions, even if blank
columns are necessary, and tables with identical
headings should stand parallel.</p>
<p>249. “Table I,” etc., in headlines of tables should ordi-
narily be set in caps of the type in which the body of
the table is set and should not exceed the width of
the table; the following (descriptive) line, if any,
should be set in caps and small caps of the same
type. A single descriptive headline, not pre-
ceded by the number of the table, should be set
in caps of the type in which the table is set. A
footnote to the table should be set in 6 pt. with a
paragraph indention, and should not exceed the
width of the table. But when 6-pt. and 8-pt. ruled
tables are both used in the same work, use 8-pt.
headings over all tables (see 234). When tables
containing footnotes run over several pages, it is
necessary to repeat the footnotes on each even page.</p>
