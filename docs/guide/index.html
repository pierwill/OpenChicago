<p>nor such words as the following, when used in</p>
<p>their special scientific or trade significance:</p>

<p>oriental customs, the southern states, the middle western states, a southerner (but: Northman = Scandinavian) ; an invasion of barbarians from the north, extending through the south of Europe.</p>
<p>In order that a distinction may be made between a local and a world-wide application, the latter should be capitalized:</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">The names of political parties, religious denomina- tions or sects, and philosophical, literary, and artistic schools, and their adherents:</p>
<p>Republican, Conservative, National Liberal, Social Democ- racy (where, as in Continental Europe, it is organized as a distinct parliamentary faction); Christian, Protestantism</p>

</ol>
<p>designations of celestial objects (see 48) (such titles to be set without space between the letters) (see 52, 103, 106).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="23">

</ol>
<p>R.V. (Revised Version), F. (Fahrenheit), C. (centigrade), A (angstrom units) (but: p., 1., n., etc.).</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="24">
<li><p class="first">Nouns and adjectives used to designate the Supreme Being or Power, or any member of the Christian Trinity; and all pronouns referring to the same, when not closely preceded or followed by a dis- tinctive name, or unless such reference is otherwise perfectly clear:</p>
<p>the Almighty, Ruler of the universe, the First Cause, the Absolute, Providence (personified), Father, Son, Holy Ghost, the Spirit, Savior, Messiah, Son of Man, the Logos, [and the Virgin Mary]; “Trust Him who rules all things” (but: “When God had worked six days, he rested on the seventh”).</p>
<p>But do not capitalize such expressions and deriva- tives as</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Words which have an acquired, limited, or special meaning:</p>
<p>the Doctor’s degree; a report of the Master (in chancery); a Bachelor’s hood; a Freshman.</p>
<p>But do not capitalize such expressions as the doctorate, a master in chancery (the last two words being explanatory, the capitalization of “master” is here no longer necessary to indicate a special meaning).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">“Nature” and similar terms, and abstract ideas, when personified:</p>
<p>“Nature wields her scepter mercilessly”; “Vice in the old English morality plays.”</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">“Father” used for church father, and “reformers” used of Reformation leaders, whenever the meaning otherwise would be ambiguous:</p>
<p>the Fathers, the early Fathers, the Greek Fathers, [Pilgrim Fathers], the Reformers (but: the church reformers of the fifteenth century).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The word “church” in properly cited titles of nationally organized bodies of believers in which, through historical associations, it has become insepa- rably linked with the name of a specific locality; or when forming part of the name of a particular edifice:</p>
<p>Church of Rome, Church of England, High Church; Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Fifth Avenue Baptist Church, First Methodist Church.</p>
<p>But do not capitalize, except as noted above, when standing alone, in any sense universal, national,</p>
<p>local or when the name is not correctly or fully quoted :</p>
<p>the church (= organized Christianity), the Eastern (Greek Orthodox) church, the Roman Catholic church, the estab- lished church (but: the Establishment), the state church; the Baptist church in Englewood.</p>
<p>NOTE. In exceptional cases, where the opposition of Church and State constitutes a fundamental part of the argument, and it is desired to lend force to this antithesis, emphasis may be added by capitalizing the two words.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" start="35">
<li><p class="first">The first word after a colon only when introducing a complete passage, or sentence which would have independent meaning, as in summarizations and quotations not closely connected with what precedes; or where the colon has the weight of such expres- sion as “as follows,” “namely,” “for instance,” or a similar phrase, and is followed by a logically com- plete sentence:</p>
<p>“In conclusion I wish to say: It will be seen from the above that ….”; “As the old proverb has it: ‘Haste makes waste’”; “My theory is: The moment the hot current strikes the surface … .”</p>
<p>But do not capitalize the first word of a quotation if immediately connected with what precedes (unless, as the first word of a sentence, beginning a paragraph in reduced type) ; or the first word after a colon, if an implied “namely,” or a similar term, is followed by a brief explanatory phrase, logically dependent upon the preceding clause:</p>
<p>“The old adage is true that ‘haste makes waste’”; “Two explanations present themselves: either he came too late for the train, or he was detained at the station.”</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">As a rule, the first word in sections of an enumera- tion, if any one link contains two or more distinct clauses, separated by a semicolon, colon, or period, unless all are dependent upon the same term pre- ceding and leading up to them (see 138) :</p>
<p>His reasons for refusal were three: (i) He did not have the time. (2) He did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no funds available at the moment. (3) He doubted the feasi- bility of the plan. But: He objected that (i) he did not have the time; (2) he did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no funds available; (3) he doubted the feasibility of the plan.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">As a rule, nouns followed by a numeral particu- larly a capitalized Roman numeral indicating their order in a sequence; also sums of money in German and French:</p>
<p>Room 16, Ps. 20, Grade IV, Act I, Vol. I, No. 2, Book II, Div. Ill, Part IV, Plate III; M. 6; Fr. 5.</p>
<p>But do not capitalize such minor subdivisions of publications as</p>
<p>sec 4, scene i, art. “Evidence,” chap. 2 (ii), p. 7 (vii), vs. n, 1. 5, n. 6. (See no.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The first word of a cited speech (or thought) in direct discourse, whether preceded by a colon or a comma (on this see 131):</p>
<p>On leaving he remarked: “Never shall I forget this day”; With the words, “Never shall I forget this day,” he departed; I thought to myself: This day I shall never forget (without quotation marks).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" start="41">
<li><p class="first">All the principal words (i.e., nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, first and last words) in English titles of publications (books, pamphlets, doc- uments, periodicals, reports, proceedings, etc.), and their divisions (parts, chapters, sections, poems, articles, etc.) ; in subjects of lectures, papers, toasts, etc.; in cap-and-small-cap and italic center-heads (both of which, however, should be avoided), and bold-face cut-in heads and side-heads; in cap-and- small-cap box-heads in tables (see 279-83) :</p>
<p>The Men Who Made the Nation; The American College Its Past and Present; the Report of the Committee oj Nine; “In the Proceedings of the National Education Association for 1907 there appeared a paper entitled, ‘The Financial Value of Education.’”</p>
<p>NOTE. The Botanical Gazette capitalizes only first words and proper names; and the practice may properly be followed in general bibliographies, such as are to be found under the title “Literature Cited” in the Botanical Gazette (see 60). This style is very generally followed by librarians and others in the com- pilation of lists of books and publications.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In foreign titles, in addition to capitalizing the first word, follow these general rules:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">

<li><p class="first">In titles with the main words capitalized, all nouns forming parts of hyphenated compounds:</p>

<p>But do not capitalize such components when other than nouns:</p>
<p>Fifty-first Street, “Lives of Well-known Authors,” “World- Dominion of English-speaking Peoples.”</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Citations, run into the text, of a passage from an author in his own words (see 85).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Quotations from different authors, or from different works by the same author, following each other, uninterrupted by any intervening original matter, or by any reference to their respective sources (other than a reference figure for a footnote), even though such quotations are reduced (see 85-87) .</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A word or phrase accompanied by its definition: “Drop-folio” means a page-number at the foot of the page.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An unusual, technical, ironical, etc., word or phrase in the text, whether or not accompanied by a word, like “so-called,” directing attention to it:</p>
<p>Her “five o’ clocks” were famous in the neighborhood; She was wearing a gown of “lobster-colored” silk; He was elected “master of the rolls”; We then repaired to what he called his “quarter deck”; A “lead” is then inserted between the lines; This so-called “man of affairs.”</p>

<p>GENERAL RULES</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Quotation marks should always include ellipses, and the phrase “etc.” when it otherwise would not be clear that it stands for an omitted part of the matter quoted, perfect clearness in each individual case being the best criterion:</p>
<p>“Art. II, sec. 2, of the Constitution provides that ‘each state shall appoint …. a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives … .’”; “He also</p>
<p>wrote a series of ‘Helps to Discovery, etc.’” “etc.” here indicating, not that he wrote other works which are unnamed, but that the title of the one named is not given in full; but, on the other hand: “Preaching from the text, ‘For God so</p>
<p>loved the world,’ etc ” “etc.” here being placed</p>
<p>outside of the quotation marks in order to show that it does not stand for other, unnamed, objects of God’s love.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Quoted prose matter (i.e., matter set with quotation marks; see above) which is broken up into para- graphs should have the quotation marks repeated at the beginning of each paragraph.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Where alignment is desired, the quotation marks should be “cleared” i.e., should project beyond the line of alignment:</p>
<p>“Keep away from dirtiness keep away from mess.  Don’t get into doin’ things rather-more-or-less ! “</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Double quotation marks are used for primary quota- tions; for a quotation within a quotation, single; going back to double for a third, to single for a fourth, and so on:</p>
<p>“Let me quote from Rossetti’s Life of Keats” he said.  “Mr. Rossetti writes as follows:</p>
<p>“‘To one of these phrases a few words of comment may be given. That axiom which concludes the “Ode on a Grecian Urn”</p>
<p>‘”“Beauty is truth, truth beauty that is all</p>
<p>Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know,” is perhaps the most important contribution to thought which the poetry of Keats contains: it pairs with and transcends</p>
<p>“‘“A thing of beauty is a joy forever.”’</p>
<p>“And now I shall conclude my first point,” he continued, “by remarking that … .”</p>

<p>When this is impracticable, or for any reason unde- sirable, reconstruct the sentence; e.g.: “The total number of those who went down with the ship was 593 men,” etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Sums of money, when occurring in isolated cases in ordinary reading-matter :</p>
<p>“The admission was two dollars.”  When several such numbers occur close together, and in all matter of a statistical character, use figures: “Admission: men, $2; women, $i; children, 25 cents.”</p>

This rule, like many another, is open to modification in particu- lar instances, for expediency, nature of context, authoritative usage, and author’s preference.

<p>“Harper Brothers have recently published … .”; “The Century Company announces … .”; “The extraordinary story of the South Sea Company.”</p>

<p>GENERAL RULES</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="112">
<li><p class="first">In extracts from modern authors whose spelling and punctuation differ but slightly from ours, and where such variations do not affect the meaning, use office style. In citations from Old English works, and in cases where it appears to be essential to the writer’s plan or the requirements of the context to give a faithful rendering, follow the original copy.  Titles should always be accurately quoted.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Form the possessive of proper names ending in s or another sibilant, if monosyllabic, by adding an apostrophe and s; if of more than one syllable, by adding an apostrophe only, except names ending in -ce (see 165) :</p>
<p>King James’s Version, Burns’s poems, Marx’s theories; Moses’ law, Jesus’ birth, Demosthenes’ orations, Berlioz’ compositions; Horace’s odes.</p>
<p>But in the case of proper names ending in a silent sibilant the possessive is formed by the addition</p>
<p>of the apostrophe and s, whether the word is</p>
<p>monosyllabic or not:</p>
<p>Charlevoix’s discoveries, Des Moines’s population.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Before sounded h, long u (or eu), and the words “one,” “once,” use “a” as the form of the indefinite article:</p>
<p>a hotel, a harmonic rendition, a historical work, a union, a euphonious word, such a one.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The ligatures &amp; and ce are not used at the present day, either in Latin and Greek words, or in words adopted into English from these languages. In English these words are written either with ae, oe, separately, or with e alone. The ligature is re- tained, however, in Old English and in French:</p>
<p>aetas; Oedipus Tyrannus; aesthetic; (but: ceuvre, French); but: maneuver; Alfred (Alfred in English).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Differentiate “farther” and “further” by using the former in the sense of “more remote,” “at a greater distance” (with verbs of action); the latter in the sense of “moreover,” “in addition”:</p>
<p>the farther end; he went still farther; further, he suggested; a further reason.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In forms of address (vocative) use the “O” without a comma following; for an exclamation use “Oh,” followed by a comma or an exclamation point (see 40) :</p>
<p>“O thou most mighty ruler!” “Oh, why did not Cerberus drag me back to hell ?”</p>

<p>v) do not use a period after contractions cases where a mechanical necessity compels the omission of a letter or letters in the middle of a word for which there is no recognized abbreviated form; such omis- sion is indicated by an apostrophe: m’f ‘g pl’t ( = manufacturing plant) ; ‘t isn’t.
c) treat the metric symbols as abbreviations, but not the chemical symbols, nor the phrase “per cent,” nor the format of books: o, fe; 2 per cent (see 94); 4to, 8vo.</p>
<p>note. with respect to symbols for measures the following exceptions should be noted: astrophysical journal, 12 mm (with thin space and no period) (but: 2 h 3 m 4 s ); botanical gazette, i2mm., i25ft.,9cc. (on line, with period).</p>
<p>manual of style: punctuation 51</p>
<p>but do not use a period, in technical matter, after the recognized abbreviations for linguistic epochs, or for titles of well-known publications of which the initials only are given, nor after ms (= manuscript), nor after mme and mile in french (see 92) : ie (=indo-european), oe (= old english), mhg (=middle high german); ajsl (= american journal of semitic languages and literatures), zaw (=zeitschrijt filr alttesta- mentliche wissenschaff), cil (= cor pus inscriptionum lati- norum), pmla (= publications of the modern language association}.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>use no period after roman numerals, even if having the value of ordinals:</li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>omit the period after running-heads (for explanation of this and the following terms see 279-83); after centered headlines; after side-heads set in separate lines; after cut-in heads; after box-heads in tables; and after superscriptions and legends which do not form a complete sentence (with subject and predi- cate), or which do not make more than a single line of type; after date lines at top of communications, and after signatures (see 50) .</li>

<p>marks or parentheses when part of the quotation or parenthetical matter; otherwise outside.  see illustrations in 127.</p>
<p>interrogation point</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the interrogation point is used to mark a query, or to express a doubt:</li>
</ol>
<p>“who is this ?” the prisoner gave his name as roger crown- inshield, the son of an english baronet ( ?). can the bible be applied to children ? is a question involved.</p>
<p>in spanish the question mark is expressed before as well as after the question, but the mark that precedes is inverted.</p>
<p>indirect questions should not be followed by an interrogation point: she asked whether he was ill.</p>
<p>a technically interrogative sentence disguised as a question out of courtesy but actually embody- ing a request does not need the interrogation point: will you kindly sign and return the inclosed card.</p>

<p>colon</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the colon is used to “mark a discontinuity of grammatical construction greater than that indicated by the semicolon and less than that indicated by the period. it is commonly used (i) to emphasize a close connection in thought between two clauses each of which forms a complete sentence, and which might with grammatical propriety be separated by a period; (2) to separate a clause which is gram- matically complete from a second which contains an illustration or amplification of its meaning; (3) to introduce a formal statement, an extract, a speech in a dialogue, etc.” (Century Dictionary] (unless this is preceded by a conjunction, like “that,” immediately connecting it with what goes before).  Before the quotation of a clause in the middle of a sentence use a comma:</li>
</ol>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>“This argument undeniably contains some force: Thus it is well known that …” “The secretion of the gland</li>
</ol>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="132">
<li>The colon thus often takes the place of an implied “namely,” “as follows,” “for instance,” or a similar phrase. Where such word or phrase is used, it should be followed by a colon if what follows consists of one or more grammatically complete clauses (see 36) ; otherwise by a comma (see 145) :</li>
</ol>
<p>“This is true of only two nations the wealthiest, though not the largest, in Europe: Great Britain and France”; but: “This is true of only two nations the wealthiest, though not the largest, in Europe viz., Great Britain and France.”  “He made several absurd statements. For example: ….”; but: “There are several states in the Union for instance, Kansas and Wyoming which … .”</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="133">
<li>Put a colon after the salutatory phrase at the begin- ning of a letter and after the introductory remark of a speaker addressing the chairman or the audi- ence:</li>

<p>SEMICOLON</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="137">
<li>A semicolon is used to mark the division of a sentence somewhat more independent than that marked by a comma, or to separate complete statements the argument of which is dependent upon their remaining in the same sentence:</li>
</ol>
<p>“Are we giving our lives to perpetuate the things that the past has created for its needs, forgetting to ask whether these things still serve today’s needs; or are we thinking of living men ?” “This is as important for science as it is for practice; indeed, it may be said to be the only important consideration.”  “It is so in war; it is so in the economic life; it cannot be otherwise in religion.” “In Persia the final decision rests with the Shah, advised by his ministers; in most constitutional countries, indirectly with the people as represented in parlia- ment; in Switzerland alone, through the referendum, directly with the electorate at large.’’ “This, let it be remembered,</p>
<p>56 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS</p>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="138">
<li>In enumerations use a semicolon between the differ- ent links, if these consist of more than a few words closely connected, and especially if individual clauses contain any punctuation mark of less value than a period, or an exclamation or interrogation point (unless inclosed in parentheses), yet are intimately joined one with the other, and all with the sentence or clause leading up to them, for instance through dependence upon a conjunction, like “that,” pre- ceding them (see 36) :</li>

For an ellipsis at the begin- ning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence four periods, separated by a space (en quad), should ordinarily be used, except in very narrow measures (in French three only, with no space between).  If the preceding line ends in a point, this should not be included in the four. Where a “whole para- graph, or paragraphs, or, in poetry, a complete line, or lines, are omitted, insert a full line of periods, separated by em- or 2-em quads, according to the length of the line.

<li><p class="first">Avoid all unnecessary divisions of words. Wherever consistent with good spacing, carry the whole word over into the next line.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Do not, in wide measures (20 ems or more), divide on a syllable of two letters, if possible to avoid it.  Never carry over a syllable of two letters. Good spacing, however, is paramount. Words of four letters like on-ly should never be divided; words of five or six like oc-cur, of-fice, let-ter rarely.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Never let more than two consecutive lines termi- nate in a hyphen, if at all avoidable. The next to the last line in a paragraph ought not to end in a divided word; and the last line (the “breakline”) should, in measures of 15 ems and up, contain at least four letters. Similarly, try to avoid a divided word at the bottom of a right-hand (recto) page.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Do not divide proper nouns, especially names of persons, unless absolutely necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Do not separate (i.e., put in different lines) the initials of a name, or such combinations as 1496 A.D., 6:00 P.M., 6 43. 6d.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Avoid the separation of a divisional mark, e.g., (a) or (i), in the middle of a sentence, from the section which it precedes; i.e., do not allow such mark to fall at the end of a line, but carry it over with the matter to which it pertains.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Divide according to pronunciation (the American system), not according to derivation (the English system) :</p>
<p>democ-racy, not: demo-cracy; knowl-edge, not: know-ledge; aurif-erous, not: auri-ferous; antip-odes (still better: antipo- des see 224), not: anti-podes.</p>
<p>As far as is compatible with pronunciation and good spacing, however, divide compounds on etymologi- cal lines, or according to derivation and meaning:</p>
<p>dis-pleasure is better than displeas-ure; school-master, than schoolmas-ter; never: passo-ver, une-ven, etc.</p>
<p>Never divide on a syllable with a silent vowel,</p>
<p>such as:</p>
<p>possi-ble, vex-ed, enti-tled, princi-ples.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When two consonants meet between vowels, and the syllable ends on one consonant, the division may properly be made between the consonants, the pronunciation determining the place of division:</p>
<p>advan-tage, exces-sive, finan-cier, foun-da-tion, impor-tant, In-dian, moun-tain, profes-sor, struc-ture.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Do not terminate a line in a soft c or g y or in a j.  Escape the division entirely, if possible; if not pos- sible, divide:</p>
<p>pro-cess, not: proc-ess; ne-cessary, not: nec-essary; spa- cing, not: spac-ing (the rule being that in present parti-</p>
<p>ciples the -ing should be carried over); pro-geny, not: prog-eny; pre-judice, not: prej-udice.</p>
<p>NOTE. This rule differs from that followed by Webster and other dictionaries.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Divide on a vowel wherever practicable. In case a vowel alone forms a syllable in the middle of a word, run it into the first line:</p>
<p>sepa-rate, not: sep-arate; particu-lar, not: partic-ular; criti-cism, not: crit-icism.</p>
<p>Exceptions are words in -able and -ible, which should</p>
<p>carry the vowel over into the next line:</p>
<p>read-able, not: reada-ble; convert-ible, not: converti-ble.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In hyphenated nouns and adjectives avoid additional hyphens:</p>
<p>object-lesson, not: object-les-son; fellow-being, not: fel- low-being; poverty-stricken, not: pov-erty-stricken, much less: pover-ty-stricken.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A coalition of two vowel-sounds into one (i.e., a diphthong) should be treated as one letter. There- fore do not divide:</p>
<p>peo-ple (either syllable makes a bad division), Cae-sar (cf. 218), bu-ilding.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In derivatives from words ending in t, the t, in divisions, should be carried into the next line with the suffix if the accent has been shifted; if the deriva- tive has retained the accent of the parent-word, the / should be left in the first line :</p>
<p>objec-tive (from ob’ject); defect-ive (from defect’); but: respec-tively, distinc-tive.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The addition of a plural s, adding a new syllable to words ending in an s-sound, does not create a new excuse for dividing such words:</p>
<p>hor-ses and circumstan-ces are impossible divisions.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="241">
<li>In n-pt. and zo-pt. matter open (unruled) tables should ordinarily be set in 9 pt. leaded; ruled, in 8 pt. solid. In 9-pt. matter both open and ruled tables should be set in 8 pt. solid. In 8-pt. matter open tables should be set in 6 pt. leaded; ruled, in 6 pt. solid. In 6-pt. matter both open and ruled tables should be set in 6 pt. solid. For columns representing totals, averages, percentages, and generalizations italic and black-face figures may be used if desired to set off the various classes of results. (See Table III, p. 100.)</li>
<li>Captions for the columns of open tables and box- heads for ruled tables should ordinarily be set in 6 pt. Box-heads of open tables should be 6-pt. caps and lower case unless subheads are used, in which case caps and small caps are used for the upper head (see Table III, p. 100). In ruled tables with box-heads of several stories the upper story pri- mary heads should be set in caps and small caps, except where the second story consists of figures only (see Table I, p. 98) ; the lower secondary in caps and lower case. Wherever small caps are used in box-heads, the heading for the “stub” (i.e., first column) should, as a rule, also be set in caps and small caps.</li>
<li>In ruled tables there should be at least two leads’ space between the horizontal rules and the matter inclosed, and, if practicable, at least the equivalent of an en quad, of the type in which the body of the table is set, between the perpendicular rules and the matter inclosed.</li>
<li>In open tables either periods, one em apart and aligned, or leaders, may be used between the col- umns (see 248). In ruled tables, in the “stub,” leaders should usually be employed, if there is room, except in case the stub runs over and a brace is necessary. (A leader is a piece of type, having dots [“period leader”] or short lines [“hyphen leader”] upon its face, used in tables, indexes, etc., to lead the eye across a space to the right word or number.) An en leader is used instead of a decimal point in tables.</li>
<li>In ruled columns of figures, to express a blank use leaders across the full width of the column. Cen- ter the figures in the column; if they cannot be put in the exact center, and there is an unequal number of digits in the groups, leave more space on the left than on the right. All decimals and dollar signs or other concrete values should be aligned.</li>
<li>When there is reading-matter in the columns of a ruled table, it should be centered, if possible; if any line runs over, use hanging indention, and align all on the left.</li>
<li>Double rules should be used at the top of all tables, but perpendicularly, as a usual thing, only when a table is doubled up on itself and the stub is re- peated. (See Table IV, p. 100.) In continued broadside tables, where the heading is not repeated use a single rule only. Repeat heading on each even page.</li>
<li>Tables of two columns only should be set open; of three or more, ruled, except in such a case as the table on page 99. All continuations of tables should be of the same dimensions, even if blank columns are necessary, and tables with identical headings should stand parallel.</li>
<li>“Table I,” etc., in headlines of tables should ordi- narily be set in caps of the type in which the body of the table is set and should not exceed the width of the table; the following (descriptive) line, if any, should be set in caps and small caps of the same type. A single descriptive headline, not pre- ceded by the number of the table, should be set in caps of the type in which the table is set. A footnote to the table should be set in 6 pt. with a paragraph indention, and should not exceed the width of the table. But when 6-pt. and 8-pt. ruled tables are both used in the same work, use 8-pt.  headings over all tables (see 234). When tables containing footnotes run over several pages, it is necessary to repeat the footnotes on each even page.</li>
