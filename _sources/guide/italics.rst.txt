Italics
=======

#. Words or phrases to which it is desired to lend emphasis, importance, etc.:

     This was, however, *not* the case.

   But beware of the excessive use of italics. The frequent use of italics for emphasis weakens the text.

#. Words and phrases from foreign languages, inserted into the English text, and not incorporated into the English language

     "The generals' *coup d'etat*";
     "the *sine qua non* of privacy".

   Do not italicize words of everyday occurrence which have become sufficiently anglicized, even though still retaining the accents of the original language.

     [example]

   .. ; and also (as a rule) single sen- tences or brief passages not of sufficient length to call for reduced type (see 85)

#. Titles of publications, books.

     *The Design of the UNIX Operating System* by Maurice Bach; *Learning Python* by Mark Lutz

#. Do not italicize:

     cf., e.g., i.e.

     .. (See list of abbreviations)

#. Letters used to designate unknown quantities, important constants, lines, etc., in algebraic, geometrical, and similar matter:

     *ac* + *bc* = *c* ( *a* + *b* ); the lines *ad* and *AD*; the *n* th power.

#. As a rule, letters in legends or in the text referring to corresponding letters in accompanying illustrations whether or not they are in italics on the illustration:

     At the point *A* above (see diagram).

     [still recommended?]

#. References to particular letters and characters: the letter *u*, a small *v*, a capital *S*.
   But do not italicize a letter used in the place of a name in hypothetical statements:

     Server A sends server B a message over the network.

     ..  or in cases where only the initial is used with a dash or as a simple abbreviation :

.. #. After headlines or titles, as a rule, the word "Con- tinued" ; and "To be continued" at the end of articles (see 179) :

   THE SCOPE OF SOCIOLOGY Continued
   [To be continued]
