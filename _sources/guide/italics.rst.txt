Italics
=======

#. Words or phrases to which it is desired to lend emphasis, importance, etc.:

     "This was, however, *not* the case"

   But beware of the excessive use of italics. The frequent use of italics for emphasis weakens the text.

#. Words and phrases from foreign languages, inserted into the English text, and not incorporated into the English language; and also (as a rule) single sen- tences or brief passages not of sufficient length to call for reduced type (see 85) :

     "the Darwinian *Weltanschauung*";
     "Napoleon's *coup d'etat*";
     "the debater *par excellence* of the Senate ";
     "*De gustibus non est disputandum*, or, as the French have it, *Chacun & son goto*."

   Do not italicize words of everyday occurrence which have become sufficiently anglicized, even though still retaining the accents of the original language:

#. Titles of publications: books

#. Do not italicize:

     cf., e.g., i.e., v. or vs. (versus)

#. Letters used to designate unknown quantities, lines, etc., in algebraic, geometrical, and similar matter:

     *ac* + *bc* = *c* ( *a* + *b* ); the lines *ad* and *AD*; the *n* th power.

#. As a rule, letters in legends or in the text referring to corresponding letters in accompanying illustra- tions whether or not they are in italics on the illustration:

   "At the point A above (see diagram)."

#. References to particular letters and characters: the letter *u*, a small *v*, a capital *S*.

   But do not italicize a letter used in the place of a name in hypothetical statements or in cases where only the initial is used with a dash or as a simple abbreviation :

     "A bought land from B without registration of title";

.. #. After headlines or titles, as a rule, the word "Con- tinued" ; and "To be continued" at the end of articles (see 179) :

   [To be continued]
