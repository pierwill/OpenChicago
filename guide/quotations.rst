Quotations
==========

#. Citations, run into the text, of a passage from an author in her own words

#. A word or phrase accompanied by its definition:

     "Drop-folio" means a page-number at the foot of the page.

.. #. An unusual, technical, ironical (etc.) word or phrase, whether or not accompanied by a word, like "so-called," directing attention to it:

     Her "five o' clocks" were famous in the neighborhood; She was wearing a gown of "lobster-colored" silk; He was elected "master of the rolls"; We then repaired to what he called his "quarter deck"; A "lead" is then inserted between the lines; This so-called "man of affairs."

.. #. In translations, the English equivalent of a word, phrase, or passage from a foreign language.

   In French small angle marks are used for quotation marks; in German two primes on one type body are used.

#. Titles of shorter works like blog posts.

#. Cited titles of subdivisions (e.g., parts, books, chap- ters, etc.) of publications; titles of papers, lectures, articles, etc.

   References to the Preface, Introduction, Table of Contents, Index, etc., of a specific work, should be set with capitalized, without quotation marks:

     Preface, p. iii; "The Introduction contains ...."; "The Appendix occupies a hundred pages"; but: "The book has a very complete index."

#. Quotation marks should always include ellipses, and the phrase "etc." when it otherwise would not be clear that it stands for an omitted part of the matter quoted, perfect clearness in each individual case being the best criterion:

..     "Art. II, sec. 2, of the Constitution provides that 'each state shall appoint .... a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives . . . .'"; "He also

       wrote a series of 'Helps to Discovery, etc.'" "etc." here indicating, not that he wrote other works which are unnamed, but that the title of the one named is not given in full; but, on the other hand: "Preaching from the text, 'For God so

       loved the world,' etc " "etc." here being placed outside of the quotation marks in order to show that it does not stand for other, unnamed, objects of God's love.

#. Quoted prose matter (i.e., matter set with quotation marks; see above) which is broken up into paragraphs should have the quotation marks repeated at the beginning of each paragraph.

#. Double quotation marks are used for primary quotations; for a quotation within a quotation, single; going back to double for a third, to single for a fourth, and so on:
