Quotations
==========

#. Citations, run into the text, of a passage from an author in his own words (see 85).

#. Quotations from different authors, or from different works by the same author, following each other, uninterrupted by any intervening original matter, or by any reference to their respective sources (other than a reference figure for a footnote), even though such quotations are reduced (see 85-87) .

#. A word or phrase accompanied by its definition: "Drop-folio" means a page-number at the foot of the page.

#. An unusual, technical, ironical, etc., word or phrase in the text, whether or not accompanied by a word, like "so-called," directing attention to it:

   Her "five o' clocks" were famous in the neighborhood; She was wearing a gown of "lobster-colored" silk; He was elected "master of the rolls"; We then repaired to what he called his "quarter deck"; A "lead" is then inserted between the lines; This so-called "man of affairs."

#. In translations, the English equivalent of a word, phrase, or passage from a foreign language : Weltanschauung, "world- view" or "fundamental aspect of life"; Mommsen, Rimische Geschichte ("History of Rome").

   l ln French small angle marks are used for quotation marks; in German two primes on one type body are used.

#. The particular or unusual word or words to which attention is directed :

   the term "lynch law"; the phrase "liberty of conscience"; the concepts "good" and "bad"; the name "Chicago."

   But not in matter discussing terms or words where

   the meaning is clear:

   The definition of the word God.

   "English Men of Letters Series"; "International Critical Commentary"; the series "Handbooks of Ethics and Religion."

#. Titles of shorter poems (see 60): Shelley's "To a Skylark."

   NOTE. The Botanical Gazette, in footnotes, does not use quotation marks for such titles.

   References to the Preface, Introduction, Table of Contents, Index, etc., of a specific work, should be set with capitals, without quotation marks:

#. Names of ships:

   the U.S. SS." Oregon."

#. Titles of pictures and works of art: Murillo's "The Holy Family."

GENERAL RULES

#. Quotation marks should always include ellipses, and the phrase "etc." when it otherwise would not be clear that it stands for an omitted part of the matter quoted, perfect clearness in each individual case being the best criterion:

   "Art. II, sec. 2, of the Constitution provides that 'each state shall appoint .... a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives . . . .'"; "He also

   wrote a series of 'Helps to Discovery, etc.'" "etc." here indicating, not that he wrote other works which are unnamed, but that the title of the one named is not given in full; but, on the other hand: "Preaching from the text, 'For God so

   loved the world,' etc " "etc." here being placed

   outside of the quotation marks in order to show that it does not stand for other, unnamed, objects of God's love.

#. Quoted prose matter (i.e., matter set with quotation marks; see above) which is broken up into para- graphs should have the quotation marks repeated at the beginning of each paragraph.

#. Where alignment is desired, the quotation marks should be "cleared" i.e., should project beyond the line of alignment:

   "Keep away from dirtiness keep away from mess.  Don't get into doin' things rather-more-or-less ! "

#. Double quotation marks are used for primary quota- tions; for a quotation within a quotation, single; going back to double for a third, to single for a fourth, and so on:

   "Let me quote from Rossetti's Life of Keats" he said.  "Mr. Rossetti writes as follows:

   "'To one of these phrases a few words of comment may be given. That axiom which concludes the "Ode on a Grecian Urn"

   '""Beauty is truth, truth beauty that is all

   Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know," is perhaps the most important contribution to thought which the poetry of Keats contains: it pairs with and transcends

   "'"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."'

   "And now I shall conclude my first point," he continued, "by remarking that . . . ."
