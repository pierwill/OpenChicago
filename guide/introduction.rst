Introduction
============

Having readable, attractive documentation that people *want* to read is essential to everything from usablility and maintainability to security.
And programmers are writers, whether they know it or not.
From creating maintainable code, to writing comments and docstrings, coding *is* writing.
Making documentation should be a chance for programmers and their teams to further their projects' goals.

This guide aims to help maintainers of documentation with a set of recommendations for both technical elements and natural language (currently, English) grammar, style, and usage.
The more existing documentation is revised to according to this style guide, the easier writing good documentation becomes.
This can be done a little at a time.

On Tools
--------

Recommending specific documentation tools and platforms is outside the scope of **OpenChicago**.
The examples use ReStructedText, but many of the recommendations are applicable to a GitHub Markdown page, for example.
