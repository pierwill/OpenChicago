Introduction
============

Readable, attractive documentation is essential to everything from usablility and maintainability to security.
Programmers are writers, whether they know it or not.
From creating maintainable code, to writing comments and docstrings, coding *is* writing.
Documentation should be a chance for programmers and their collaborations to further communicate with users.

This guide aims to help documentation maintainers with a set of recommendations for both technical elements and natural language (currently, English) grammar, stylem, and usage.
The more existing documentation is revised to according to this style guide, the easier writing good documentation becomes.
This can be done a little at a time.

On Tools
--------

Recommending specific documentation tools and platforms is outside the scope of this guide.
Since it is based on the author's work on `SecureDrop <https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/>`_, the examples are for ReStructedText using something like Sphinx or Read the Docs.

But many of the recommandations are applicable to GitHub READMEs in Markdown, for example.

.. note:: Some of the examples here are left intact from the 1920 source text.
