<h2>Colon<a class="headerlink" href="#colon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">the colon is used to mark a discontinuity of grammatical construction greater than that indicated by the semicolon and less than that indicated by the period. It is commonly used (i) to emphasize a close connection in thought between two clauses each of which forms a complete sentence, and which might with grammatical propriety be separated by a period; (2) to separate a clause which is grammatically complete from a second which contains an illustration or amplification of its meaning.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The fear of death is universal: even the lowest animals instinctively shrink from annihilation.”</p>
<p>“Most countries have a national flower: France the lily, England the rose, etc.” “Lambert pine: the gigantic sugar pine of California.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The colon should be placed outside the quotation marks, unless a part of the quotation:</p>

<div class="section" id="semicolon">
<h2>Semicolon<a class="headerlink" href="#semicolon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">A semicolon is used to mark the division of a sentence somewhat more independent than that marked by a comma, or to separate complete statements the argument of which is dependent upon their remaining in the same sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“This is as important for science as it is for practice; indeed, it may be said to be the only important consideration.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In enumerations, use a semicolon between the items if these consist of more than a few words closely connected, and especially if individual clauses contain any punctuation mark of less value than a period, or an exclamation or interrogation point (unless inclosed in parentheses), yet are intimately joined one with the other, and all with the sentence or clause leading up to them, for instance through dependence upon a conjunction, like “that,” preceding them.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[Examples]</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The semicolon should be placed outside the quotation marks or parentheses, unless a part of the quotation or parenthetical matter.</p>
</li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="comma">
<h2>Comma<a class="headerlink" href="#comma" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">The comma is used to indicate the smallest interruptions in continuity of thought or grammatical construction, the marking of which contributes to clearness.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">(“Oxford Comma”) Put a comma before “and,” “or,” and “nor” connecting the last two links in a sequence of three or more; or all the links in a series of greater length, or where each individual link consists of several words; always put a comma before “etc.”:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Tom, Dick, and Harry; either copper, silver, or gold; “He was equally familiar with Homer, and Shakspere, and Moliere, and Cervantes, and Goethe, and Ibsen”; “Neither France for her art, nor Germany for her army, nor England for her democracy, etc.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>But do not use a comma where “and,” etc., serves to connect all of the links in a brief and close-knit phrase :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“a man good and noble and true”; “I do not remember who wrote the stanza whether it was Shelley or Keats or Moore.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Ordinarily, put a comma before and after clauses introduced by such conjunctions as “and,” “but,” “or,” “if,” “while,” “as” (meaning “since”), “whereas,” “since,” “because,” “when,” “after,” “although,” etc., especially if a change of subject takes place:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When he arrived at the railway station, the train had gone, and his friend, who had come to bid him goodbye, had departed, but left no word. As the next train was not due for two hours, he decided to take a ride about the town, although it offered little of interest to the sightseer. While he regretted his failure to meet his friend, he did not go to his house.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If among several adjectives preceding a noun the last bears a more direct relation to the noun than the others, it should not be preceded by a comma:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[adjective comma example]</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Participial clauses, especially such as contain an explanation of the main clause, should usually be set off by a comma:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Being asleep, he did not hear him”; “Exhausted by a day’s hard work, he slept like a stone.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Put a comma before “not” introducing an antithetical clause or phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[example]</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For parenthetical, adverbial, or appositional clauses or phrases use commas to indicate structurally disconnected, but logically integral, interpolations;</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Since, from the naturalistic point of view, mental states are the concomitants of physiological processes … .</p>
<p>The French, generally speaking, are a nation of artists</p>
<p>The English, highly democratic as they are, nevertheless deem the nobility fundamental to their political and social systems.</p>
<p>There was a time I forget the exact date when these conditions were changed.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In adjectival phrases a complementary, qualifying, delimiting, or antithetical adjective added to the main epithet preceding a noun should ordinarily be preceded and followed by a comma:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“This harsh, though at the same time perfectly logical, conclusion”; “The deceased was a stern and unapproach- able, yet withal sympathetic and kind-hearted, gentleman ” ; “Here comes in the most responsible, because it is the final, office of the teacher”; “The most sensitive, if not the most elusive, part of the training of children”; “The better a proverb is, the more trite it usually becomes.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Two or more co-ordinate clauses ending in a word governing or modifying another word in a following clause should be separated by commas :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“… . a shallow body of water connected with, but well protected from, the open sea”; “He was as tall as, though much younger than, his brother”; “The cultivation in our- selves of a sensitive feeling on the subject of veracity is one of the most useful, and the enfeeblement of that feeling one of the most hurtful, things”; “This road leads away from, rather than toward, your destination.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A direct quotation, maxim, or similar expression, when brief, should be separated from the preceding part of the sentence by a comma.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“God said, Let there be light.” [Bad example]</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Put a comma after digits indicating thousands, 1 except in a date or in a page-reference and not between the constituents of dimensions, weights, and measures:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1,276, 10,419; 2200 BCE; p. 2461; 3 feet 6 inches; 4 Ib.  2 oz. ; 2 hr. 4 min.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Separate month and year and similar time divisions by a comma:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>November, 1905;
New Year’s Day, 1906</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The comma is always placed inside the quotation marks, but following the parenthesis.</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="section" id="apostrophe">
<h2>Apostrophe<a class="headerlink" href="#apostrophe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">An apostrophe is used to mark the omission of a letter or letters in the contraction of a word, or of figures in a number.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>it’s, ne’er,  the class of ‘96; don’t, haven’t.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The possessive case of nouns, common and proper, is formed by the addition of an apostrophe.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>horses’ tails; Scott’s Ivanhoe, Jones’s farms, Themistodes’ era; for appearance’ sake</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>#. Do not use an apostraphe with the plural of numerals or letters.
.. #. The plural of numerals, and of rare or artificial noun- coinages, is formed by the aid of an apostrophe and s; of proper nouns of more than one syllable ending in a sibilant, by adding an apostrophe alone (mono- syllabic proper names ending in a sibilant add es; others, s) (see 101) :</p>
<blockquote>
<div>in the i goo’s; in two’s and three’s, the three R’s, the Y.M.C.A.’s; “these I-just-do-as-I-please’s”; “all the Tommy Atkins’ of England” (but: the Rosses and the Macdougals); the Pericles’ and Socrates’ of literature.</div></blockquote>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Use an en dash in place of the word “to” connecting two words or numbers.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>But if the word “from” precedes the first word or number, do not use the dash instead of “to”:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>From May 1 to July 1, 1906.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In connecting consecutive numbers omit hundreds from the second number i.e., use only two figures unless the first number ends in two ciphers, in which case repeat; if the next to the last figure in the first number is a cipher, do not repeat this in the second number; but in citing dates B.C. always repeat the hundreds (because representing a dimi- nution, not an increase) (see 158) :</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>“The reasons for his resignation were three: (i) advanced age, (2) failing health, (3) a desire to travel.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Parentheses should not ordinarily be used for paren- thetical clauses (see 150 and 167) unless confusion might arise from the use of less distinctive marks, or unless the content of the clause is wholly irrelevant to the main argument:</p>
<blockquote>

<h2>Brackets<a class="headerlink" href="#brackets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<div class="section" id="ellipses">
<h2>Ellipses<a class="headerlink" href="#ellipses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Ellipses are used to indicate the omission, from a quotation, of one or more words not essential to the idea which it is desired to convey, and also to indicate illegible words, mutilations, and other lacunae in a document, manuscript, or other mate- rial which is quoted. For an ellipsis at the begin- ning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence four periods, separated by a space (en quad), should ordinarily be used, except in very narrow measures (in French three only, with no space between).  If the preceding line ends in a point, this should not be included in the four. Where a “whole para- graph, or paragraphs, or, in poetry, a complete line, or lines, are omitted, insert a full line of periods, separated by em- or 2-em quads, according to the length of the line. But the periods should not extend beyond the length of the longest type-line:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The point … . is that the same forces …. are still</p>
<p>the undercurrents of every human life We may</p>
<p>never unravel the methods of the physical forces; …..  but ….</p>
<p>I think it worth giving you these details, because it is a vague thing, though a perfectly true thing, to say that it was by his genius that Alexander conquered the eastern world.</p>
<p>His army, you know, was a small one. To carry a</p>
<p>vast number of men ….</p>
<p>“Aux armes! … aux armes! … les Prussiens!”</p>

<p>moi-me’me … j’ai deja publie quelques petits ouvrages …”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An ellipsis should be treated as a part of the citation; consequently should be inclosed in the quotation marks (see 178 [3]).</p>

<div class="section" id="hyphens">
<h2>Hyphens<a class="headerlink" href="#hyphens" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>Do not hyphenate combinations of adverb and adjective where no ambiguity could result.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>an ever increasing flood.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Where one of the components contains more than one word, an en dash should be used in place of a hyphen.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>EXAMPLES</p>

<p>But do not connect by a hyphen adjectives or par- ticiples with adverbs ending in “-ly”; nor such combinations as the foregoing when following the noun, or qualifying a predicate: highly developed species; a man well known in the neighbor- hood; the fly-leaf, so called; “Her gown and carriage were strictly up to date.”</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Hyphenate, as a rule, nouns formed by the combination of two nouns standing in objective relation to each other that is, one of whose components is derived from a transitive verb:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>mind-reader, story-teller, fool-killer, office-holder, well-wisher, property-owner; hero-worship, wood-turning, clay-modeling, curriculum -making.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">Adjectives formed by the suffixation of “like” to a noun are usually printed as one word if the noun contains only one syllable (except when ending in /); if it contains more (or is a proper noun), they should be hyphenated:</p>
