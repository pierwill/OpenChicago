Use of italics
==============

#. Words or phrases to which it is desired to lend emphasis, importance, etc.:

   "This was, however, *not* the case"

   But beware of the excessive use of italics, for the appearance of the over-italicized page is not pleasing and the too frequent use of italics for emphasis weakens the text.

#. Words and phrases from foreign languages, inserted into the English text, and not incorporated into the English language; and also (as a rule) single sen- tences or brief passages not of sufficient length to call for reduced type (see 85) :

   "the Darwinian *Weltanschauung*";
   "Napoleon's coup d'etat";
   "the debater par excellence of the Senate ";
   "De gustibus non est disputandum, or, as the French have it, Chacun & son goto."
 
   But do not italicize foreign titles preceding names,
   or names of foreign institutions or places the meaning
   or position of which in English would have required
   roman type, and which either are without English
   equivalents or are by preference used in lieu of these:
 
   Pere Lagrange, Freiherr von Schwenau; the German
   Reichstag, the Champs Elysees, the Museo delle Tenne;
 
   nor words of everyday occurrence which have become
   sufficiently anglicized, even though still retaining the
   accents of the original language:
 
 
   1 But italicize v. or vs. when standing between two opposing terms not
   themselves italicized (see 63) when otherwise the meaning would not be clear:
   Michigan vs. Minnesota, 3 to o.
 
   But do not hyphenate any of these foreign words
   when used as adjectives.

#. Titles of publications books (including plays, essays, cycles of poems, single poems of considerable length, and symphonies, usually printed separately, and not from the context understood to form parts of a large volume [see 81]), pamphlets, treatises, tracts, documents, operas, oratorios, and periodicals (in- cluding regularly appearing proceedings and trans- actions; and also the name of a journal appearing in the journal itself, and the word "journal," "review," etc., standing alone, if a part of the name of the publication) (see 41) ; and in the case of newspapers, periodicals, etc., the name of the city (where published) when forming an integral part of the name :

   Spencer, Principles of Sociology; A Midsummer-Night's
   Dream; Idylls of the King; Paradise Lost; The Messiah;
   Lohengrin; the Modern Language Review, the Chicago
   Tribune, the Indianapolis Star, Report of the United Slates
   Commissioner of Education, Groningen Publications, No. 27.

   Books of the Bible, both canonical and apocryphal, and titles of ancient manuscripts should be set in roman type, as also symbols used to designate manuscripts (see 31 and 44) : Psalms 53: 10, Di6, Mb, P, J.

   But do not italicize

   cf., e.g., i.e., v. or vs. (versus) (unless ambiguity would result; see note to 59), viz., etc.
   
#. Letters used to designate unknown quantities, lines, etc., in algebraic, geometrical, and similar matter: ac+bc=c(a+b); the lines ad and A D; the nth power.

#. As a rule, letters in legends or in the text referring to corresponding letters in accompanying illustra- tions whether or not they are in italics on the illustration :

   "At the point A above (see diagram)."

#. References to particular letters: the letter u, a small v, a capital S.

   But do not italicize a letter used in the place of a name in hypothetical statements or in cases where

   only the initial is used with a dash or as a simple abbreviation :

   "A bought land from B without registration of title";

   "The news was brought at once to General M "; "Mr.

   G. was not at home when we called."

      
#. In zoological, geological, and paleontological mat- ter, scientific (Latin) names of genera and species when used together, the generic name being in the nominative singular :
   
   Felis leo, Rosa Carolina, Conodectes favosus, Phyteuma Halleri. (See 46, 48.)

   In botanical, geological, and paleontological matter, the names of genera and species when used together, and of genera, only, when used alone: Acer saccharum, Basidiobolus, Alternaria, Erythrosuchits.  In medical matter, however, the general practice is to print such names in roman, avoiding italics altogether.

   In astronomical and astrophysical matter :
   a) The lower-case letters designating certain Fraunhof er lines : a, b, g, h.

   6) The lower-case letters used by Baeyer to desig- nate certain stars in constellations for which the Greek letters have been exhausted: f Tauri, u Herculis.

   c) When initials are used to express the titles of catalogues, as such, and not to designate a particular celestial object, such initials are to be italicized (see 48, 60) : B.D.,N.G.C.

   d} Symbols for the chemical elements: H, Ca, Ti.

   In accordance with the best modern practice, italics should no longer be used for:

   a) The capital letters given by Fraunhofer to spectral lines : A-H, and K.

   6) The letters designating the spectral types of

   stars :

   AS, 64, Mb.

   c) The capital letter H with different Greek letters, used to designate the various lines of hydrogen: Ha, H/?, etc.

#. After headlines or titles, as a rule, the word "Con- tinued" ; and "To be continued" at the end of articles (see 179) :

   THE SCOPE OF SOCIOLOGY Continued
   [To be continued]
