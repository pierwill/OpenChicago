FOOTNOTES

232. For reference indexes, as a rule, use superior figures.  Only in special cases should asterisks, daggers, etc., be employed (see 234); for instance, in tabular or algebraic matter, where figures would be likely to cause confusion. Index figures in the text should be placed after the punctuation marks, without space, except in German, where they are placed inside:

     1 In particular the avoidance of hiatus.  p^y+jt*

     * Schenk's equation.

     When figures are not used, the sequence of indexes should be:

     ("asterisk" or "star"), f ("dagger"), % ("double dagger"), ("section mark"), || ("parallels"), ^ ("paragraph mark").

233. Where references to the same work follow each other closely and uninterruptedly, use ibid, instead of repeating the title. Thus ibid, takes the place of as much of the previous reference as is repeated:

     Spencer, Principles of Sociology, chap, iv., p. 128.

     Ibid., p. 129.

     Barnes, "Charles Stunner," Jour, of Pol. Econ., XXXV, 427.

     Ibid., p. 435-

     Ibid, should, however, not ordinarily be used for the first footnote on a verso (left-hand) page; it is


     better usage either to repeat the title or, if the reference is to the whole citation, to use loc. cit.  (the place cited) or op. cit. (the work cited) or a.a.O. (am angezeigten Orte) in German:

     'Smith, Wealth of Nations, p. 289.

     3 Loc. cit. (on verso page if exactly the same place is cited), or

     3 Smith, op. cit., p. 290.

     However op. cit. is not used to repeat the title of a journal, but it may be used to refer to an author's work in a periodical and should not be used with- out the author's name clearly in text or footnote.

234. Footnotes to tables, whether the tables are ruled or open, should be in 6 pt, and should invariably be placed at the foot of the table and not at the foot of the page. For reference indexes in such cases use asterisks, etc., and not superior figures (see 232).

235. If the author's name is given in the text in connec- tion with a reference to, or a quotation from, his work, it should not be repeated in the footnote:

     This theory is questioned by Herbert, as follows- "I cannot admit . . . ."'

     1 Laws of the Ancients, 1, 153.

236. It is better to place the index figure in the text at the end of the quotation (see illustration above).

237. Ordinarily, omit "Vol.," "chap.," and "p." in paren-

     thetical or footnote references to particular pas- sages. Use Roman numerals (capitals) for Volume,

     Book, Part, Division, except in reference to ancient classical works, when lower-case roman numerals should be used; Roman numerals (lower-case) for chapter and pages of introductory matter (Preface, etc.) ; and Arabic numerals for number (Heft) and text pages. Only when confusion would be liable to arise, use " Vol.," "p.," etc., in connection with the numerals; but where the reference is to a page, un- accompanied by further details, the abbreviation "p." or "pp." must of course be used. In text matter, not parenthetical, spell out chapter, verse, page, line, note, figure, etc. In classical references use no comma between author's name and the title of his work, and no comma following the title, unless "Vol.," "p.," or some kindred symbol is used. In all references to divisions of classical or ancient works use periods in place of commas, reserving the comma to indicate a succession (of pages, etc.) :

     1 Miller, French Rev. (ad ed.; London: Abrahams, 1888), II, Part IV, iii.

     Curtiss, "The Place of Sacrifice among Primitive Semites," Biblical World, XXI (1903), 248 ff.

     JP. 63; pp. 27-36.

     Cicero De officiis i. 133, 140.  De div. per somn. i, p. 4630.

     'Fraser, The Golden Bough*, I, 27 [superior figure within punctuation indicating number of the edition].

     The same practice prescribed for classical references is frequently desired by authors with respect to English references, and may with equal propriety be followed:

     1 W. W. Greg Pastoral Poetry and Pastoral Drama (London 1906) 114.

238. The date of publication in a reference to a periodical should be put in parentheses immediately following the volume number:

     1 Barnes, "Lester Frank Ward," Amer. Jour, of Social., XXV (1919), 89.

     If the citation is to month, year, and page only, the date may appear in its natural order with commas:

     3 "Problems of Reconstruction," Journal of Political Economy, May, 1919, p. 89.

239. In work set on the linotype machine, footnotes should be renumbered consecutively through each article, in a journal, or through each chapter, in a book, to save resetting in case of change (see "Hints to Authors and Editors," note under "Footnotes," p. 122).

     NOTE. Exceptions to these rules are footnotes in the Botani- cal Gazette and the Astrophysical Journal, which have adopted the following styles:

     Botanical Gazette

     1 LIVINGSTON, B. E., (i) On the nature of the stimulus which causes the change in form of polymorphic green algae. BOT.  GAZ. 30:289-317. 1900.

     3 , (2) The heredity of sex. Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool.

     40:187-218. 1903.

     Astrophysical Journal

     1 " Revision of Wolf's Sun-Spot Relative Numbers," Monthly Weather Review, 30, 171, 1902.

     3 Astrophysical Journal, 10, 333, 1899.

     Botanical Gazette numbers its footnotes consecutively through- out an article; all the other journals of the University of Chicago Press number their footnotes from i up on each page, except in special cases.
