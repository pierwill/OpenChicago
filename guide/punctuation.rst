Punctuation
===========

Period
------

#. A period is used to indicate the end of a declarative sentence.

#. Put a period after abbreviations:

     Mr. Smith; St. Paul; no. 1

#. Do not put a period in titles or section titles.

#. Periods are always placed inside the quotation marks.

     The Terms of Service use the word "privacy."

#. Periods are always placed inside the parentheses when the matter enclosed is an independent sentence and forms no part of the preceding sentence; otherwise outside.

     Eric said he had paid the vendor. (He hadn't.)

   When the parentheses form part of the preceding sentence as a whole, put the period outside (as, for instance, here).

     When two parentheses form part of the preceding sentence, put the period outside (as, for instance, here).

Exclamation Point
-----------------

#. The exclamation point is used to mark an outcry or an emphatic or ironic utterance. Some people don't like them, but do not be afraid of exclamation points!

#. Exclamation points are best used in documentation to express joy or warning.

     You are now ready to play *SimDefenestrationOfPrague*!

     Do not delete ``/usr/bin``!

#. Exclamation points are placed inside the quotation marks or parentheses when part of the quotation or parenthetical matter; otherwise outside.

   .. check on this

Question Mark
-------------

#. The question mark is used to mark a query, or to express a doubt.

     "Who is this?"

#. Indirect questions should not be followed by a question mark.

     The prompt will ask whether the user wants FAT32 or ExFAT.

Colon
-----

#. The colon is used to mark a discontinuity of grammatical construction greater than that indicated by the semicolon and less than that indicated by the period. It is commonly used (i) to emphasize a close connection in thought between two clauses each of which forms a complete sentence, and which might with grammatical propriety be separated by a period; (2) to separate a clause which is grammatically complete from a second which contains an illustration or amplification of its meaning.

     "The fear of death is universal: even the lowest animals instinctively shrink from annihilation."

     "Most countries have a national flower: France the lily, England the rose, etc." "Lambert pine: the gigantic sugar pine of California."

#. The colon should be placed outside the quotation marks, unless a part of the quotation:

     He writes under the head of "Notes and Comments":

     "Many a woman can testify to the truth of the old adage:"

Semicolon
---------

#. A semicolon is used to mark the division of a sentence somewhat more independent than that marked by a comma, or to separate complete statements the argument of which is dependent upon their remaining in the same sentence:

     "This is as important for science as it is for practice; indeed, it may be said to be the only important consideration."

#. In enumerations, use a semicolon between the items if these consist of more than a few words closely connected, and especially if individual clauses contain any punctuation mark of less value than a period, or an exclamation or interrogation point (unless inclosed in parentheses), yet are intimately joined one with the other, and all with the sentence or clause leading up to them, for instance through dependence upon a conjunction, like "that," preceding them.

     [Examples]

#. The semicolon should be placed outside the quotation marks or parentheses, unless a part of the quotation or parenthetical matter.

Comma
-----

#. The comma is used to indicate the smallest interruptions in continuity of thought or grammatical construction, the marking of which contributes to clearness.

#. Put a comma before "and," "or," and "nor" connecting the last two links in a sequence of three or more; or all the links in a series of greater length, or where each individual link consists of several words ("Oxford Comma").

     [EXAMPLES]

#. Always put a comma before "etc.".

     [EXAMPLE]

..   But do not use a comma where "and," etc., serves to connect all of the links in a brief and close-knit phrase :

     "a man good and noble and true"; "I do not remember who wrote the stanza whether it was Shelley or Keats or Moore."

#. Ordinarily, put a comma before and after clauses introduced by such conjunctions as "and," "but," "or," "if," "while," "as" (meaning "since"), "whereas," "since," "because," "when," "after," "although," etc., especially if a change of subject takes place:

     When he arrived at the railway station, the train had gone, and his friend, who had come to bid him goodbye, had departed, but left no word.
     As the next train was not due for two hours, he decided to take a ride about the town, although it offered little of interest to the sightseer.
     While he regretted his failure to meet his friend, he did not go to his house.

#. If among several adjectives preceding a noun the last bears a more direct relation to the noun than the others, it should not be preceded by a comma:

     [adjective comma example]

..     "the admirable political institutions of the country"; "a hand- some, wealthy young man."

#. Participial clauses, especially such as contain an explanation of the main clause, should usually be set off by a comma:

     "Being asleep, he did not hear him"; "Exhausted by a day's hard work, he slept like a stone."

#. Put a comma before "not" introducing an antithetical clause or phrase:

     [example]

   ..     "Men addict themselves to inferior pleasures, not because they deliberately prefer them, but because they are the only ones to which they have access."

   .. Participial clauses, especially such as contain an explanation of the main clause, should usually be set off by a comma:

#. For parenthetical, adverbial, or appositional clauses or phrases use commas to indicate structurally disconnected, but logically integral, interpolations;

     Since, from the naturalistic point of view, mental states are the concomitants of physiological processes . . . .

#. In adjectival phrases a complementary, qualifying, delimiting, or antithetical adjective added to the main epithet preceding a noun should ordinarily be preceded and followed by a comma:

     "This harsh, though at the same time perfectly logical, conclusion";
     ; "Here comes in the most responsible, because it is the final, office of the teacher";
     "The better a proverb is, the more trite it usually becomes."

#. Two or more co-ordinate clauses ending in a word governing or modifying another word in a following clause should be separated by commas :

     "...a shallow body of water connected with, but well protected from, the open sea";
     "He was as tall as, though much younger than, his brother";
     "The cultivation in ourselves of a sensitive feeling on the subject of veracity is one of the most useful, and the enfeeblement of that feeling one of the most hurtful, things";
     "This road leads away from, rather than toward, your destination."

#. A direct quotation, maxim, or similar expression, when brief, should be separated from the preceding part of the sentence by a comma.

     .. "God said, Let there be light." [Bad example]

#. Put a comma after digits indicating thousands, except in a date or in a page-reference and not between the constituents of dimensions, weights, and measures:

     1,276; 10,419; 2200 BCE; p. 2461; 3 feet 6 inches; 4 lb. 2 oz.; 2 hr. 4 min.

#. Separate month and year and similar time divisions by a comma:

     November, 1905;
     New Year's Day, 1906

#. The comma is always placed inside the quotation marks, but following the parenthesis.

     [Examples]

Apostrophe
----------

#. An apostrophe is used to mark the omission of a letter or letters in the contraction of a word, or of figures in a number.

     it's, ne'er,  the class of '96; don't, haven't.

#. The possessive case of nouns, common and proper, is formed by the addition of an apostrophe.

     horses' tails; Scott's Ivanhoe, Jones's farms, Themistodes' era; for appearance' sake

#. Do not use an apostraphe with the plural of numerals or letters.

   .. #. The plural of numerals, and of rare or artificial noun- coinages, is formed by the aid of an apostrophe and s; of proper nouns of more than one syllable ending in a sibilant, by adding an apostrophe alone (mono- syllabic proper names ending in a sibilant add es; others, s) (see 101) :

      in the i goo's; in two's and three's, the three R's, the Y.M.C.A.'s; "these I-just-do-as-I-please's"; "all the Tommy Atkins' of England" (but: the Rosses and the Macdougals); the Pericles' and Socrates' of literature.

Quotation Marks
---------------
See `Quotations </guide/index.html#quotations>`_

Dashes
------

#. An em dash is used to denote a sudden break, stop, or transition in a sentence, or an abrupt change in its construction, a long or significant pause.

     [em dash examples]

.. #. Use dashes (rarely parentheses see 177) for par- enthetical clauses which are both logically and structurally independent interpolations (see 150):

     "This may be said to be but, never mind, we will pass over that"; "There came a time let us say, for convenience, with Herodotus and Thucydides when this attention to actions was conscious and deliberate"; "If it be asked and in say- ing this I but epitomize my whole contention why the Mohammedan religion . . . ."

   A clause added to lend emphasis to, or to explain or expand, a word or phrase occurring in the main clause, which word or phrase is then repeated, should be introduced by a dash:

     "To him they are more important as the sources for history the history of events and ideas"; "Here we are face to face with a new and difficult problem new and difficult, that is, in the sense that . . . . "

#. Use an en dash in place of the word "to" connecting two words or numbers.

     Mayâ€“July, 1906; pages 3-7

   But if the word "from" precedes the first word or number, do not use the dash instead of "to":

     From May 1 to July 1, 1906.

   In connecting consecutive numbers omit hundreds from the second number i.e., use only two figures unless the first number ends in two ciphers, in which case repeat; if the next to the last figure in the first number is a cipher, do not repeat this in the second number; but in citing dates B.C. always repeat the hundreds (because representing a dimi- nution, not an increase) (see 158) :

     1880-95, PP- 1I 3~ 1 ^', 1900-1906, pp. 102-7; 387-324 B.C.

.. #. Let a dash precede the reference (author, title of work, or both) following a direct quotation, consisting of at least one complete sentence, in footnotes or cited independently in the text (see 85) :

     1 "I felt an emotion of the moral sublime at beholding such an instance of civic heroism." Thirty Years, I, 379.  The green grass is growing,

     The morning wind is in it, 'Tis a tune worth the knowing Though it change every minute.

     Emerson, "To Ellen, at the South."

Parentheses
-----------

#. Place between parentheses figures or letters used to mark divisions in enumerations run into the text:

     "The reasons for his resignation were three: (i) advanced age, (2) failing health, (3) a desire to travel."

#. Parentheses should not ordinarily be used for paren- thetical clauses (see 150 and 167) unless confusion might arise from the use of less distinctive marks, or unless the content of the clause is wholly irrelevant to the main argument:

     "He meant I take this to be the (somewhat obscure) sense of his speech that . . . ."; "The period thus inaugurated (of which I shall speak at greater length in the next chapter) was characterized by ...."; "The contention has been made (op. cit.) that . . . ."

Brackets
--------

#. Brackets are used (1) to inclose an explanation or note, (2) to indicate an interpolation in a quotation, to rectify a mistake, (4) to supply an omission, and (5) for parentheses within parentheses:

     [This was written before the publication of Spencer's book]

     "These [the free-silver Democrats] asserted that the present artificial ratio can be maintained indefinitely."

     "As the Italian [Englishman] Dante Gabriel Ros- [s]etti has said, . . . ."

     Grote, the great historian of Greece (see his History, I, 204 [second edition] ),....

Ellipses
--------

#. Ellipses are used to indicate the omission, from a quotation, of one or more words not essential to the idea which it is desired to convey, and also to indicate illegible words, mutilations, and other lacunae in a document, manuscript, or other mate- rial which is quoted. For an ellipsis at the begin- ning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence four periods, separated by a space (en quad), should ordinarily be used, except in very narrow measures (in French three only, with no space between).  If the preceding line ends in a point, this should not be included in the four. Where a "whole para- graph, or paragraphs, or, in poetry, a complete line, or lines, are omitted, insert a full line of periods, separated by em- or 2-em quads, according to the length of the line. But the periods should not extend beyond the length of the longest type-line:

     The point . . . . is that the same forces .... are still

     the undercurrents of every human life We may

     never unravel the methods of the physical forces; .....  but ....

     I think it worth giving you these details, because it is a vague thing, though a perfectly true thing, to say that it was by his genius that Alexander conquered the eastern world.

     His army, you know, was a small one. To carry a

     vast number of men ....

     "Aux armes! ... aux armes! ... les Prussiens!"

     "Je n'ecris que ce que j'ai vu, entendu, senti ou eprouve

     moi-me'me ... j'ai deja publie quelques petits ouvrages ..."

#. An ellipsis should be treated as a part of the citation; consequently should be inclosed in the quotation marks (see 178 [3]).

Hyphens
-------

#. Hyphenate two or more words (except proper names forming a unity in themselves) combined into one adjective preceding a noun, or into one pronoun.

     so-called Croesus, well-known author, first-class investment, better-trained teachers, high-school course, half-dead horse, much-mooted question, joint-stock company, English-speaking peoples, nineteenth-century progress, white-rat serum, up-to- date machinery, four-year-old boy, house-to-house canvass, go-as-you-please fashion, deceased-wife's-sister bill; the feeble-minded (person) ; but : New Testament times, Old English spelling, an a priori argument.

   Do not hyphenate combinations of adverb and adjective where no ambiguity could result.

     an ever increasing flood.

   Where one of the components contains more than one word, an en dash should be used in place of a hyphen.

     EXAMPLES

   But do not connect by a hyphen adjectives or par- ticiples with adverbs ending in "-ly"; nor such combinations as the foregoing when following the noun, or qualifying a predicate: highly developed species; a man well known in the neighbor- hood; the fly-leaf, so called; "Her gown and carriage were strictly up to date."

#. Hyphenate, as a rule, nouns formed by the combination of two nouns standing in objective relation to each other that is, one of whose components is derived from a transitive verb:

     mind-reader, story-teller, fool-killer, office-holder, well-wisher, property-owner; hero-worship, wood-turning, clay-modeling, curriculum -making.

#. "Half," "quarter," etc., combined with a noun should be followed by a hyphen:

   half-truth, half- tone; half-year, half-title, quarter-mile; but not the adverb "halfway."

#. "Semi-," "demi-," "bi-," "tri-," etc., do not ordina- rily demand a hyphen, unless followed by i, w, or y:

     semiannual, demigod, bipartisan, bichromate, bimetallist, trimonthly, tricolor, trifoliate, semi-incandescent, bi- weekly, tri-yearly.

#. Compounds of "self," when this word forms the first element of the compound, are hyphenated: self-evident, self-respect.

#. Combinations with "fold" are to be printed as one word if the number contains only one syllable; if it contains more, as two:

     twofold, tenfold; fifteen fold, a hundred fold.

#. Adjectives formed by the suffixation of "like" to a noun are usually printed as one word if the noun contains only one syllable (except when ending in /); if it contains more (or is a proper noun), they should be hyphenated:

     childlike, homelike, warlike, godlike; eel-like, bell-like; woman-like, business-like; American -like (but: Christlike).

.. #. The prefixes " co-," " pre-," and " re-," when followed by the same vowel as that in which they terminate, or by w or y, or by any letter that forms a diph- thong with the last letter of the prefix, except in very common words, take a hyphen; but, as a rule, they do not when followed by a different vowel or by a consonant, except to avoid mispronunciation :

     co-operation, pre-empted, re-enter, co-worker, re-yield; but: coequal, coeducation, prearranged, reinstal; cohabita- tion, prehistoric, recast (but: re-use, re-read, co-author).  NOTE. The Botanical Gazette prints: cooperate, reenter, etc.

     Exceptions are combinations with proper names, long or unusual formations, and words in which the

     omission of the hyphen would convey a meaning different from that intended (cf . 9, 19, 208) :

     pre-Raphaelite, re-democratize, re-pulverization; re-cover ( = cover again), re-creation, re-formation (as distinguished from reformation).

#. In fractional numbers, spelled out, connect by a hyphen the numerator and the denominator, unless either already contains a hyphen:

       "The year is two-thirds gone"; four and five-sevenths; thirty one-hundredths; but: thirty-one hundredths.

     But do not hyphenate in such cases as

       "One half of his fortune he bequeathed to his widow; the other, to charitable institutions."

#. In the case of two or more compound words occurring together, which have one of their component elements in common, this element is frequently omitted from all but the last word, and its implication should be indicated by a hyphen :

     in English- and Spanish-speaking countries; one-, five-, and ten-cent pieces; "If the student thinks to find this character where many a literary critic is searching in fifth- and tenth- century Europe he must not look outside of manuscript tradition."
