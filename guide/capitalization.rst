Capitalization
==============

Capitalize:

#. Proper nouns and adjectives:

     Aaron, Berlin, Oakland, Ubuntu, Tor; Norwegian, Buddhist

   .. (Brand names, project names, software, linux names, commands+programs)

#. Abbreviations like PGP, PhD, CS.

.. #. Abbreviations consisting of one letter

     R.V. (Revised Version), F. (Fahrenheit), C. (centigrade), A (angstrom units) (but: p., 1., n., etc.).

#. The first word after a colon only when introducing a complete passage, or sentence which would have independent meaning, as in summarizations and quotations not closely connected with what precedes; or where the colon has the weight of such expres- sion as "as follows," "namely," "for instance," or a similar phrase, and is followed by a logically com- plete sentence:

      "In conclusion I wish to say: It will be seen from the above that ...."; "As the old proverb has it: 'Haste makes waste'"; "My theory is: The moment the hot current strikes the surface . . . ."

    But do not capitalize the first word of a quotation if immediately connected with what precedes (unless, as the first word of a sentence, beginning a paragraph in reduced type) ; or the first word after a colon, if an implied "namely," or a similar term, is followed by a brief explanatory phrase, logically dependent upon the preceding clause:

      "The old adage is true that 'haste makes waste'"; "Two explanations present themselves: either he came too late for the train, or he was detained at the station."

.. #. As a rule, the first word in sections of an enumer tion, if any one link contains two or more distinct clauses, separated by a semicolon, colon, or period, unless all are dependent upon the same term preceding and leading up to them (see 138) :

    His reasons for refusal were three: (i) He did not have the time. (2) He did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no funds available at the moment. (3) He doubted the feasibility of the plan. But: He objected that (i) he did not have the time; (2) he did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no funds available; (3) he doubted the feasibility of the plan.

#. In mentioning titles of newspapers, magazines, and similar publications, do not, as a rule, treat the definite article as part of the title:

     the Chicago Tribune, the School Review, the Annual Register of the University of Chicago.

#. In titles with the main words capitalized, all nouns forming parts of hyphenated compounds:

     "Set-Up the Server"

   But do not capitalize such components when other than nouns:

     Fifty-first Street, "Lives of Well-known Authors," "World- Dominion of English-speaking Peoples."
