Capitalization
==============

#. Proper nouns and adjectives:

   George, America, North America, Englishman; Elizabethan, French. (See :ref:`here <warn>`.)

   Do not capitalize verbs derived from proper names and having a specialized meaning:

   to boycott, to fletcherize, to pasteurize;

   nor such words as the following, when used in

   their special scientific or trade significance:

   volt, ampere, angstrom, farad, watt, henry, ohm, coulomb.

#. Epithets used as substitutes for proper names, or affixed to a name:

   the Pretender, Bloody Mary, Richard the Lion-hearted, Alexander the Great.

#. The particles in French names, a: "le," "la," "de," "du," when they are not preceded by a Christian name or title; but do not capitalize them when they are preceded by such name or title:

   Le Bossu, La Torre, La Rochelle, De Coligny, D'Aubigne*, Du Maurier (but: Rene le Bossu, Miguel de la Torre, Gaspard de Coligny, Thomas d'Aubigne, George du Maurier).

   Capitalize "Van" in Dutch names; do not capi- talize "von" in German names unless it begins a sentence:

   Stephen Van Rensselaer; Hugo von Martius, von Dobschiitz.

   NOTE. Personal preference is responsible for the following ex- ceptions: Henry van Dyke, J. H. van't Hoff, A. van Maanen.

#. Ordinals used to designate Egyptian dynasties, sessions of Congress, names of regiments, and in similar connections (see 100):

    the Eighteenth Dynasty (but: the Ming dynasty), the Fifty-third Congress, the Second Illinois Regiment Band.

#. Commonly accepted appellations for historical epochs, periods in the history of a language or literature, and geological ages and strata, the word "age" itself being capitalized only where a failure to do so would result in ambiguous meaning:

    Neolithic age (but: Stone Age, Middle Ages), Crusades, Renaissance, Reformation, Inquisition, Commonwealth (Cromwell's), Commune (Paris); Old English (OE see 123), Middle High German (MHG), the Age of Elizabeth; Pleistocene, Silurian, Lower Carboniferous, Christian Era.

#. Names of important events:

    Thirty Years' War, Peasants' War (German), Revolution (French), Revolutionary War or War of Independence (American), Whiskey Insurrection (American), Civil War (American), War of 1812, Franco-Prussian War, Battle of Gettysburg; Peace of Utrecht, Louisiana Purchase.

#. Abbreviations like Ph.D., M.P., and F.R.G.S., and

#. Abbreviations consisting of one letter, except in case of units of measurement and minor literary subdivisions (see 54, 55, no, in):

    R.V. (Revised Version), F. (Fahrenheit), C. (centigrade), A (angstrom units) (but: p., 1., n., etc.).

#. Words which have an acquired, limited, or special meaning:

    the Doctor's degree; a report of the Master (in chancery); a Bachelor's hood; a Freshman.

    But do not capitalize such expressions as the doctorate, a master in chancery (the last two words being explanatory, the capitalization of "master" is here no longer necessary to indicate a special meaning).

#. The first word after a colon only when introducing a complete passage, or sentence which would have independent meaning, as in summarizations and quotations not closely connected with what precedes; or where the colon has the weight of such expres- sion as "as follows," "namely," "for instance," or a similar phrase, and is followed by a logically com- plete sentence:

    "In conclusion I wish to say: It will be seen from the above that ...."; "As the old proverb has it: 'Haste makes waste'"; "My theory is: The moment the hot current strikes the surface . . . ."

    But do not capitalize the first word of a quotation if immediately connected with what precedes (unless, as the first word of a sentence, beginning a paragraph in reduced type) ; or the first word after a colon, if an implied "namely," or a similar term, is followed by a brief explanatory phrase, logically dependent upon the preceding clause:

    "The old adage is true that 'haste makes waste'"; "Two explanations present themselves: either he came too late for the train, or he was detained at the station."

#. As a rule, the first word in sections of an enumera- tion, if any one link contains two or more distinct clauses, separated by a semicolon, colon, or period, unless all are dependent upon the same term pre- ceding and leading up to them (see 138) :

    His reasons for refusal were three: (i) He did not have the time. (2) He did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no funds available at the moment. (3) He doubted the feasi- bility of the plan. But: He objected that (i) he did not have the time; (2) he did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no funds available; (3) he doubted the feasibility of the plan.

#. As a rule, nouns followed by a numeral particu- larly a capitalized Roman numeral indicating their order in a sequence; also sums of money in German and French:

    Room 16, Ps. 20, Grade IV, Act I, Vol. I, No. 2, Book II, Div. Ill, Part IV, Plate III; M. 6; Fr. 5.

    But do not capitalize such minor subdivisions of publications as

    sec 4, scene i, art. "Evidence," chap. 2 (ii), p. 7 (vii), vs. n, 1. 5, n. 6. (See no.)

#. The first word of a cited speech (or thought) in direct discourse, whether preceded by a colon or a comma (on this see 131):

    On leaving he remarked: "Never shall I forget this day"; With the words, "Never shall I forget this day," he departed; I thought to myself: This day I shall never forget (without quotation marks).

#. All the principal words (i.e., nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, first and last words) in titles of works:

.. TITLES

#. In mentioning titles of newspapers, magazines, and similar publications, do not, as a rule, treat the definite article as part of the title:

    the Chicago Tribune, the School Review, the Annual Register of the University of Chicago.

#. In titles with the main words capitalized, all nouns forming parts of hyphenated compounds:

    "Twentieth-Century Progress," "The Economy of High- Speed Trains."

    But do not capitalize such components when other than nouns:

    Fifty-first Street, "Lives of Well-known Authors," "World- Dominion of English-speaking Peoples."

    And in side-heads do not capitalize any but the first word and proper nouns (see 56 and 172).

#. The names of town and state in the date line, and the salutatory phrase at the beginning, of letters, and the signature and residence at the end of letters or articles, etc.:

    CHICAGO, ILL., January i, 1911

    (Set to the right, with one em's indention, and preferably in smaller type than the body of the letter.)

    MY DEAR MR. SMITH:

    (Set flush, followed by a colon, in the same type as the body of the letter, and in a separate line, unless preceded by another line giving the name and address, in which case it

    should be run in with the text of the letter, indented as a paragraph [see 64].)

    CHARLES W. SCOTT

    (Set to the right, with one em's indention, and in the same type as the body of the letter or article.)

    HARVARD UNIVERSITY

    CAMBRIDGE, MASS.

    June 7, 1911

    (Set to the left, with two ems' indention, in smaller type.)  (Each line of the address should be in caps and small caps, and should be centered on the one preceding. The date should be in caps and lower case, likewise centered on those above.)

#. A.M. and P.M. (ante and post meridiem)

    ?

#. In literary references, such minor subdivisions and their abbreviations as

    chapter, section, page, article, verse, line, note; chap., sec., p., art., vs., 1., n. (See 37, no, and 237.)

#. Units of measurement as

    h.=hour, min.=minute, sec.=second; lb.=pound, oz.= ounce; yd.=yard, ft. = foot; etc.

#. The first word of a quotation which, through a con- junction or otherwise, is immediately connected with what precedes, even if such word in the original begins a sentence.

    For illustration and exception see 35 and 131.
