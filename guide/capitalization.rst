Capitalization
==============

   George, America, North America, Englishman; Elizabethan, French. (See 53.)

   Do not capitalize verbs derived from proper names and having a specialized meaning:

   to boycott, to fletcherize, to pasteurize;

   nor such words as the following, when used in

   their special scientific or trade significance:

   volt, ampere, angstrom, farad, watt, henry, ohm, coulomb.

#. Epithets used as substitutes for proper names, or affixed to a name:

   the Pretender, Bloody Mary, Richard the Lion-hearted, Alexander the Great.

   Le Bossu, La Torre, La Rochelle, De Coligny, D'Aubigne*, Du Maurier (but: Rene le Bossu, Miguel de la Torre, Gaspard de Coligny, Thomas d'Aubigne, George du Maurier).

   Capitalize "Van" in Dutch names; do not capi- talize "von" in German names unless it begins a sentence:

   Stephen Van Rensselaer; Hugo von Martius, von Dobschiitz.

   NOTE. Personal preference is responsible for the following ex- ceptions: Henry van Dyke, J. H. van't Hoff, A. van Maanen.


5. Adjectives and nouns used singly or in conjunction, to distinguish definite regions, and when used in connection with a recognized geographical term; and also terms applied to groups of states:

   Old World, Western Hemisphere, Continental Europe, the Continent (to distinguish it from the British Isles), North Pole, Equator, the North ( = Scandinavia), the East (the Orient), the Far East, the Levant; the North, South, East, West, Middle West (United States) ; Northern Europe (but : southern California); North Atlantic states, Gulf states, Pacific Coast states.

   But do not, as a rule, capitalize adjectives derived from such names or nouns simply designating direction or point of compass:

   oriental customs, the southern states, the middle western states, a southerner (but: Northman = Scandinavian) ; an invasion of barbarians from the north, extending through the south of Europe.

   In order that a distinction may be made between a local and a world-wide application, the latter should be capitalized:

   Eastern peoples (i.e., peoples of the Orient); Western nations.

6. Generic terms for political divisions:

   (1) when the term is an organic part of the name, following the proper name directly :

   Holy Roman Empire, German Empire (=Deutsches Reich), French Republic (=Republique franfaise), United Kingdom, Northwest Territory, Cook County, Evanston Township, Kansas City (New York City exception).

   (2) when, with the preposition "of," it is used as an integral part of the name to indicate certain minor administrative subdivisions in the United States:

   Department of the Lakes, Town of Lake, Borough of Man- hattan.

   (3) when used singly as the accepted designation for a specific division:

   the Union, the States, the Republic (= United States), [the Confederacy], the Dominion (= Canada), the West Side.

   (4) when it is part of a fanciful or popular appel- lation used as if a real geographical name :

   Celestial Empire, Holy (Promised) Land, Badger State, Eternal City, Garden City.

   But do not capitalize such general designations of buildings as "courthouse," "post-office," "library," etc., except in connection with the name of the place in which they are located, when they thus form a proper name.

9. The names of political parties, religious denomina- tions or sects, and philosophical, literary, and artistic schools, and their adherents:

   Republican, Conservative, National Liberal, Social Democ- racy (where, as in Continental Europe, it is organized as a distinct parliamentary faction); Christian, Protestantism

14. Commonly accepted appellations for historical epochs, periods in the history of a language or literature, and geological ages and strata, the word "age" itself being capitalized only where a failure to do so would result in ambiguous meaning:

25. Words which have an acquired, limited, or special meaning:

    the Doctor's degree; a report of the Master (in chancery); a Bachelor's hood; a Freshman.

    But do not capitalize such expressions as the doctorate, a master in chancery (the last two words being explanatory, the capitalization of "master" is here no longer necessary to indicate a special meaning).

26. "Nature" and similar terms, and abstract ideas, when personified:

    "Nature wields her scepter mercilessly"; "Vice in the old English morality plays."

27. "Father" used for church father, and "reformers" used of Reformation leaders, whenever the meaning otherwise would be ambiguous:

    But do not capitalize, except as noted above, when standing alone, in any sense universal, national,

    local or when the name is not correctly or fully quoted :

    the church (= organized Christianity), the Eastern (Greek Orthodox) church, the Roman Catholic church, the estab- lished church (but: the Establishment), the state church; the Baptist church in Englewood.

    NOTE. In exceptional cases, where the opposition of Church and State constitutes a fundamental part of the argument, and it is desired to lend force to this antithesis, emphasis may be added by capitalizing the two words.


35. The first word after a colon only when introducing a complete passage, or sentence which would have independent meaning, as in summarizations and quotations not closely connected with what precedes; or where the colon has the weight of such expres- sion as "as follows," "namely," "for instance," or a similar phrase, and is followed by a logically com- plete sentence:

    "In conclusion I wish to say: It will be seen from the above that ...."; "As the old proverb has it: 'Haste makes waste'"; "My theory is: The moment the hot current strikes the surface . . . ."

    But do not capitalize the first word of a quotation if immediately connected with what precedes (unless, as the first word of a sentence, beginning a paragraph in reduced type) ; or the first word after a colon, if an implied "namely," or a similar term, is followed by a brief explanatory phrase, logically dependent upon the preceding clause:

    "The old adage is true that 'haste makes waste'"; "Two explanations present themselves: either he came too late for the train, or he was detained at the station."

36. As a rule, the first word in sections of an enumera- tion, if any one link contains two or more distinct clauses, separated by a semicolon, colon, or period, unless all are dependent upon the same term pre- ceding and leading up to them (see 138) :

    His reasons for refusal were three: (i) He did not have the time. (2) He did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no funds available at the moment. (3) He doubted the feasi- bility of the plan. But: He objected that (i) he did not have the time; (2) he did not have the means; or, at any rate, had no funds available; (3) he doubted the feasibility of the plan.

37. As a rule, nouns followed by a numeral particu- larly a capitalized Roman numeral indicating their order in a sequence; also sums of money in German and French:

    Room 16, Ps. 20, Grade IV, Act I, Vol. I, No. 2, Book II, Div. Ill, Part IV, Plate III; M. 6; Fr. 5.

    But do not capitalize such minor subdivisions of publications as

    sec 4, scene i, art. "Evidence," chap. 2 (ii), p. 7 (vii), vs. n, 1. 5, n. 6. (See no.)

38. The first word of a cited speech (or thought) in direct discourse, whether preceded by a colon or a comma (on this see 131):

    On leaving he remarked: "Never shall I forget this day"; With the words, "Never shall I forget this day," he departed; I thought to myself: This day I shall never forget (without quotation marks).

41. All the principal words (i.e., nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, first and last words) in English titles of publications (books, pamphlets, doc- uments, periodicals, reports, proceedings, etc.), and their divisions (parts, chapters, sections, poems, articles, etc.) ; in subjects of lectures, papers, toasts, etc.; in cap-and-small-cap and italic center-heads (both of which, however, should be avoided), and bold-face cut-in heads and side-heads; in cap-and- small-cap box-heads in tables (see 279-83) :

    The Men Who Made the Nation; The American College Its Past and Present; the Report of the Committee oj Nine; "In the Proceedings of the National Education Association for 1907 there appeared a paper entitled, 'The Financial Value of Education.'"

    NOTE. The Botanical Gazette capitalizes only first words and proper names; and the practice may properly be followed in general bibliographies, such as are to be found under the title "Literature Cited" in the Botanical Gazette (see 60). This style is very generally followed by librarians and others in the com- pilation of lists of books and publications.

42. In foreign titles, in addition to capitalizing the first word, follow these general rules:

    a) In Latin, capitalize proper nouns, and adjectives

    derived therefrom:

    De amicitia, Bettum Gallicum.

    6) In French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and Nor- wegian titles, capitalize proper nouns but not ad- jectives derived therefrom :

    Histoire de la litterature franfaise, Novelle e racconti popolari iialiani, Antologia de poetas liricos castellanos, Svenska littera- turens historic.

   c} In German and Danish, capitalize all nouns but not the adjectives, except German adjectives derived from the names of persons:

    Geschichte des deutschen Feudalwesens (but: die Homer ische Frage), Videnskabens Fremskridt i detnittende Aarhundrede; and in abbreviations, B.P.W. for Berliner philologische W ochenschrift.

   d) In Dutch, capitalize all nouns, and all adjectives derived from proper nouns: Geschiedenis der Nederlandsche Taal.

43. In mentioning titles of newspapers, magazines, and similar publications, do not, as a rule, treat the definite article as part of the title:

    the Chicago Tribune, the School Review, the Annual Register of the University of Chicago.

44. Titles of ancient manuscripts (singular, MS; plural, MSS) (see 60):

    Codex Bernensis, Cod. Canonicianus.

45. In titles with the main words capitalized, all nouns forming parts of hyphenated compounds:

    "Twentieth-Century Progress," "The Economy of High- Speed Trains."

    But do not capitalize such components when other than nouns:

    Fifty-first Street, "Lives of Well-known Authors," "World- Dominion of English-speaking Peoples."

    And in side-heads do not capitalize any but the first word and proper nouns (see 56 and 172).

46. In botanical, geological, zoological, and paleonto- logical matter, the scientific (Latin) names of divi- sions, orders, families, and genera, but not their English derivatives:

    Cotylosauria, but: cotylosaurs; Felidae, but: felids; Carnivora, but: carnivores.

    Also in botanical and zoological matter, the names of species, if derived from names of persons, or from generic names; but in geological and medical matter the names of species are never capitalized:

    MY DEAR MR. SMITH:

    (Set flush, followed by a colon, in the same type as the body of the letter, and in a separate line, unless preceded by another line giving the name and address, in which case it

    should be run in with the text of the letter, indented as a paragraph [see 64].)

    NOTE. It should be noticed that ....

    SECTION i. This association shall be styled ....

    The usual practice is to abbreviate the word "section" each time it is used in such a connection except the first:

    SECTION i. The name of the association ....  SEC. 2. The object of the association ....

SET IN SMALL CAPITALS

52. A.M. and P.M. (ante and post meridiem), and B.C.  and A.D. ("before Christ" and anno Domini); these
