<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Readable, attractive documentation is essential to everything from usablility and maintainability to security.
Programmers are writers, whether they know it or not.
From creating maintainable code, to writing comments and docstrings, coding <em>is</em> writing.
Documentation should be a chance for programmers and their collaborations to further communicate with users.</p>
<p>This guide aims to help documentation maintainers with a set of recommendations for both technical elements and natural language (currently, English) grammar, style, and usage.
The more existing documentation is revised to according to this style guide, the easier writing good documentation becomes.
This can be done a little at a time.</p>

<h2>On Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#on-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Recommending specific documentation tools and platforms is outside the scope of this guide.
Since it is based on the author’s work on <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/">SecureDrop</a>, the examples use ReStructedText.

<div class="section" id="colon">
<h2>Colon<a class="headerlink" href="#colon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">the colon is used to mark a discontinuity of grammatical construction greater than that indicated by the semicolon and less than that indicated by the period. It is commonly used (i) to emphasize a close connection in thought between two clauses each of which forms a complete sentence, and which might with grammatical propriety be separated by a period; (2) to separate a clause which is grammatically complete from a second which contains an illustration or amplification of its meaning.</p>
<p>“This argument undeniably contains some force: Thus it is well known that …” “The secretion of the gland goes on uninterruptedly: this may account for the condition of the organ.” “The fear of death is universal: even the lowest animals instinctively shrink from annihilation.” (2) “Most countries have a national flower: France the lily, England the rose, etc.” “Lambert pine: the gigantic sugar pine of California.” (3) “The rule may be stated thus: … .” “We quote from the address: … .” “Charles: ‘Where are you going?’ George: ‘To the mill-pond.’”  But: “He stoutly maintained that ‘the letter is a monstrous forgery’”; and: “Declaring, ‘The letter is a monstrous forgery,’ he tried to wash his hands of the whole affair.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">The colon should be placed outside the quotation marks, unless a part of the quotation:</p>
<blockquote>

“Many a woman can testify to the truth of the old adage:”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="semicolon">
<h2>Semicolon<a class="headerlink" href="#semicolon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">A semicolon is used to mark the division of a sentence somewhat more independent than that marked by a comma, or to separate complete statements the argument of which is dependent upon their remaining in the same sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Are we giving our lives to perpetuate the things that the past has created for its needs, forgetting to ask whether these things still serve today’s needs; or are we thinking of living men ?”
“This is as important for science as it is for practice; indeed, it may be said to be the only important consideration.”
“It is so in war; it is so in the economic life; it cannot be otherwise in religion.”
“In Persia the final decision rests with the Shah, advised by his ministers; in most constitutional countries, indirectly with the people as represented in parlia- ment; in Switzerland alone, through the referendum, directly with the electorate at large.”
“This, let it be remembered, was the ground taken by Mill; for to him ‘utilitarianism,’ in spite of all his critics may say, did not mean the pursuit of bodily pleasure.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In enumerations, use a semicolon between the different links, if these consist of more than a few words closely connected, and especially if individual clauses contain any punctuation mark of less value than a period, or an exclamation or interrogation point (unless inclosed in parentheses), yet are intimately joined one with the other, and all with the sentence or clause leading up to them, for instance through dependence upon a conjunction, like “that,” pre- ceding them (see 36) :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The membership of the international commission was made up as follows: France, 4; Germany, 5; Great Britain, i (owing to a misunderstanding, the announcement did not reach the English societies in time to secure a full quota from that country. Sir Henry Campbell, who had the matter in charge, being absent at the time, great difficulty was experi- enced in arousing sufficient interest to insure the sending of even a solitary delegate); Italy, 3; the United States, 7.”  “The defendant, in justification of his act, pleaded that (i) he was despondent over the loss of his wife; (2) he was out of work; (3) he had had nothing to eat for two days; (4) he was under the influence of liquor.” “Presidents Hadley, of Yale; Eliot, of Harvard; Butler, of Columbia; and Angell, of Michigan.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The semicolon should be placed outside the quotation marks or parentheses, unless a part of the quotation or parenthetical matter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comma">
<h2>Comma<a class="headerlink" href="#comma" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">The comma is “used to indicate the smallest interruptions in continuity of thought or grammatical construction, the marking of which contributes to clearness.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Here, as in many other cases, what is sometimes popularly supposed to be orthodox is really a heresy, an exaggeration, a distortion, a caricature of the true doctrine of the church.  The doctrine is, indeed, laid down by an authority here and there; but, speaking generally, it has no place in the stand- ards, creeds, or confessions of the great communions; e.g., the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, the canons of the early ecumenical councils, the Westminster Confession, the Thirty- nine Articles.” “Shakspere and other, lesser, poets.” “The books which I have read I herewith return” (i.e., I return those [only] which I have read); but: “The books, which I have read, I herewith return” (i.e., having read them [all], I now return them). “Gossiping, women are happy”; and: “Gossiping women are happy.” “Of these four, two Ameri- cans and one Englishman started”; and: “Of these, four two Americans and two Englishmen started.” “The suffer- ing, God will relieve.” “Behind, her ‘stage mother’ stood fluttering with extra wraps.” “Some boys and girls pre- maturely announce themselves, usually in uncomfortable, sometimes in bad, ways.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Put a comma before “and,” “or,” and “nor” connecting the last two links in a sequence of three or more; or all the links in a series of greater length, or where each individual link consists of several words; always put a comma before “etc.”:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Tom, Dick, and Harry; either copper, silver, or gold; “He was equally familiar with Homer, and Shakspere, and Moliere, and Cervantes, and Goethe, and Ibsen”; “Neither France for her art, nor Germany for her army, nor England for her democracy, etc.”</p>
<p>But do not use a comma where “and,” etc., serves to connect all of the links in a brief and close-knit phrase :</p>
<p>“a man good and noble and true”; “I do not remember who wrote the stanza whether it was Shelley or Keats or Moore.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Ordinarily, put a comma before and after clauses in- troduced by such conjunctions as “and,” “but,” “or,” “if,” “while,” “as” (meaning “since”), “whereas,” “since,” “because,” “when,” “after,” “although,” etc., especially if a change of subject takes place:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“When he arrived at the railway station, the train had gone, and his friend, who had come to bid him goodbye, had departed, but left no word. As the next train was not due for two hours, he decided to take a ride about the town, although it offered little of interest to the sightseer. While he regretted his failure to meet his friend, he did not go to his house.”</p>
<p>But do not use a comma before clauses introduced by such conjunctions if the preceding clause is not logically complete without them; nor before “if,” “but,” and “though” in brief and close-welded phrases:</p>
<p>“This is especially interesting because they represent the two extremes and because they present differences in their rela- tions”; “This is good because true”; “I shall agree to this only if you accept my conditions”; “I would not if I could, and could not if I would”; “honest though poor”; “a cheap but valuable book.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Such conjunctions, adverbs, connective particles, or phrases as “now,” “then,” “however,” “indeed,” “therefore,” “moreover,” “furthermore,” “never- theless,” “though,” “in fact,” “in short,” “for instance,” “that is,” “of course,” “on the contrary,” “on the other hand,” “after all,” “to be sure,” “for example,” etc., may be followed by a comma when standing at the beginning of a sentence or clause to introduce an inference or an explanation, and may be placed between commas when wedged into the middle of a sentence or clause to mark off a distinct break in the continuity of thought or struc- ture, indicating a summarizing of what precedes, the point of a new departure, or a modifying, restrict- ive, or antithetical addition, etc. :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Indeed, this was exactly the point of the argument”; “Moreover, he did not think it feasible”; “Now, the question is this: … .” “Nevertheless, he consented to the scheme”; “In fact, rather thi reverse is true”; “This, then, is my position: … .”; “The statement, therefore, cannot be verified”; “He thought, however, that he would like to try”; “That, after all, seemed a trivial matter”; “The gentleman, of course, was wrong”; “A comma may be used between clauses of a compound sentence that are connected by a simple con junction, though a comma is emphatically not used between clauses connected by a conjunctive adverb.”</p>
<p>But do not use a comma with such words when the connection is logically close and structurally smooth enough not to call for any pause in reading; with “therefore,” “nevertheless,” etc., when directly following the verb; with “indeed” when directly preceding or following an adjective or another adverb which it qualifies; nor ordinarily with such terms as “perhaps,” “also,” “likewise,” etc.:</p>
<p>“Therefore I say unto you … .”; “He was therefore unable to be present”; “It is nevertheless true”; “He is recovering very slowly indeed”; “He was perhaps thinking of the future”; “He was a scholar and a sportsman too.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A comma is preferably omitted before “rather” in such an expression as</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The time-value is to be measured in this way rather than by the time-equivalent of the strata.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If among several adjectives preceding a noun the last bears a more direct relation to the noun than the others, it should not be preceded by a comma:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“the admirable political institutions of the country”; “a hand- some, wealthy young man.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Participial clauses, especially such as contain an explanation of the main clause, should usually be set off by a comma :</p>
<p>“Being asleep, he did not hear him”; “Exhausted by a day’s hard work, he slept like a stone.”</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Put a comma before “not” introducing an antithetical clause or phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Men addict themselves to inferior pleasures, not because they deliberately prefer them, but because they are the only ones to which they have access.”</p>
<p>But do not use commas before such words when the thought is incomplete without the following words.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For parenthetical, adverbial, or appositional clauses or phrases use commas to indicate structurally disconnected, but logically integral, interpolations; dashes to indicate both structurally and logically disconnected insertions ; never use the two together (see 175):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Since, from the naturalistic point of view, mental states are the concomitants of physiological processes … .”; “The French, generally speaking, are a nation of artists”; “The English, highly democratic as they are, nevertheless deem the nobility fundamental to their political and social systems.”  “There was a time I forget the exact date when these conditions were changed.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use a comma to separate two identical or closely similar words, even if the sense or grammatical con- struction does not require such separation (see 142) :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Whatever is, is good”; “What he was, is not known”; “The chief aim of academic striving ought not to be, to be most in evidence “; “This is unique only in this, that … .”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In adjectival phrases a complementary, qualifying, delimiting, or antithetical adjective added to the main epithet preceding a noun should ordinarily be preceded and followed by a comma:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“This harsh, though at the same time perfectly logical, conclusion”; “The deceased was a stern and unapproach- able, yet withal sympathetic and kind-hearted, gentleman ” ; “Here comes in the most responsible, because it is the final, office of the teacher”; “The most sensitive, if not the most elusive, part of the training of children”; “The better a proverb is, the more trite it usually becomes.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Two or more co-ordinate clauses ending in a word governing or modifying another word in a following clause should be separated by commas :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“… . a shallow body of water connected with, but well protected from, the open sea”; “He was as tall as, though much younger than, his brother”; “The cultivation in our- selves of a sensitive feeling on the subject of veracity is one of the most useful, and the enfeeblement of that feeling one of the most hurtful, things”; “This road leads away from, rather than toward, your destination.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Similarly, use a comma to separate two numbers: “In 1905, 347 teachers attended the convention”; November i, 1905. (See 160.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A comma is employed to indicate the omission, for brevity or convenience, of a word or words the repetition of which is not essential to the meaning : “In Illinois there are seventeen such institutions; in Ohio, twenty-two; in Indiana, thirteen” ; “In Lincoln’s first cabinet Seward was secretary of state; Chase, of the treasury; Cameron, of war; and Bates, attorney general.”</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Often, however, such constructions are smooth enough not to call for commas (and consequent semicolons) : “One puppy may resemble the father, another the mother, and a third some distant ancestor.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A direct quotation, maxim, or similar expression, when brief, should be separated from the preceding part of the sentence by a comma (see 131) :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>” God said, Let there be light.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use a comma before “of” in connection with resi- dence or position:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Mr. and Mrs. Mclntyre, of Detroit, Mich.; President Hadley, of Yale University.</p>
<p>Exceptions are those cases, historical and political, in which the place-name practically has become a part of the person’s name, or is so closely connected with this as to render the separation artificial or illogical:</p>
<p>Clement of Alexandria, Philip of Anjou, King Edward of England.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Put a comma after digits indicating thousands, 1 except in a date or in a page-reference and not between the constituents of dimensions, weights, and measures:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1,276, 10,419; 2200 B.C.; p. 2461; 3 feet 6 inches; 4 Ib.  2 oz. ; 2 hr. 4 min.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Separate month and year and similar time divisions by a comma:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>November, 1905 ; New Year’s Day, 1906.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Omit the comma, in signatures and at the beginning of articles, after author’s name followed by address, title, or position in a separate line, or after address followed by a date line, etc. (see 65).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The comma is always placed inside the quotation marks, but following the parenthesis, if the con- text requires it at all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="apostrophe">
<h2>Apostrophe<a class="headerlink" href="#apostrophe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">An apostrophe is used to mark the omission of a letter or letters in the contraction of a word, or of figures in a number. In the case of contractions containing a verb and the negative, do not use space between the two components of the contraction:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>it’s, ne’er, ‘twas, “takin’ me ‘at”; m’f’g; the class of ‘96; don’t, haven’t. (See 123.)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The possessive case of nouns, common and proper, is formed by the addition of an apostrophe, or apostrophe and 5 (see 113) :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a man’s word, horses’ tails; Scott’s Ivanhoe, Jones’s farms, Themistodes’ era; for appearance’ sake.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The plural of numerals, and of rare or artificial noun- coinages, is formed by the aid of an apostrophe and s; of proper nouns of more than one syllable ending in a sibilant, by adding an apostrophe alone (mono- syllabic proper names ending in a sibilant add es; others, s) (see 101) :</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>in the i goo’s; in two’s and three’s, the three R’s, the Y.M.C.A.’s; “these I-just-do-as-I-please’s”; “all the Tommy Atkins’ of England” (but: the Rosses and the Macdougals); the Pericles’ and Socrates’ of literature.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Use an en dash in place of the word “to” connecting two words or numbers.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>But if the word “from” precedes the first word or number, do not use the dash instead of “to”:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In connecting consecutive numbers omit hundreds from the second number i.e., use only two figures unless the first number ends in two ciphers, in which case repeat; if the next to the last figure in the first number is a cipher, do not repeat this in the second number; but in citing dates B.C. always repeat the hundreds (because representing a dimi- nution, not an increase) (see 158) :</p>

<h2>Ellipses<a class="headerlink" href="#ellipses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Ellipses are used to indicate the omission, from a quotation, of one or more words not essential to the idea which it is desired to convey, and also to indicate illegible words, mutilations, and other lacunae in a document, manuscript, or other mate- rial which is quoted. For an ellipsis at the begin- ning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence four periods, separated by a space (en quad), should ordinarily be used, except in very narrow measures (in French three only, with no space between).  If the preceding line ends in a point, this should not be included in the four. Where a “whole para- graph, or paragraphs, or, in poetry, a complete line, or lines, are omitted, insert a full line of periods, separated by em- or 2-em quads, according to the length of the line. But the periods should not extend beyond the length of the longest type-line:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The point … . is that the same forces …. are still</p>
<p>the undercurrents of every human life We may</p>
<p>never unravel the methods of the physical forces; …..  but ….</p>
<p>I think it worth giving you these details, because it is a vague thing, though a perfectly true thing, to say that it was by his genius that Alexander conquered the eastern world.</p>
<p>His army, you know, was a small one. To carry a</p>
<p>vast number of men ….</p>
<p>“Aux armes! … aux armes! … les Prussiens!”</p>
<p>“Je n’ecris que ce que j’ai vu, entendu, senti ou eprouve</p>
<p>moi-me’me … j’ai deja publie quelques petits ouvrages …”</p>
</div></blockquote>

<li><p class="first">An ellipsis should be treated as a part of the citation; consequently should be inclosed in the quotation marks (see 178 [3]).</p>
